Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions,What If?,1,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21413662,"Randall Munroe left NASA in 2005 to start up his hugely popular site XKCD 'a web comic of romance, sarcasm, math and language' which offers a witty take on the world of science and geeks. It now has 600,000 to a million page hits daily. Every now and then, Munroe would get emails asking him to arbitrate a science debate. 'My friend and I were arguing about what would happen if a bullet got struck by lightning, and we agreed that you should resolve it . . . ' He liked these questions so much that he started up What If.
If your cells suddenly lost the power to divide, how long would you survive?
How dangerous is it, really, to be in a swimming pool in a thunderstorm?
If we hooked turbines to people exercising in gyms, how much power could we produce?
What if everyone only had one soulmate?
When (if ever) did the sun go down on the British empire?
How fast can you hit a speed bump while driving and live?
What would happen if the moon went away?
In pursuit of answers, Munroe runs computer simulations, pores over stacks of declassified military research memos, solves differential equations, and consults with nuclear reactor operators. His responses are masterpieces of clarity and hilarity, studded with memorable cartoons and infographics. They often predict the complete annihilation of humankind, or at least a really big explosion. Far more than a book for geeks, WHAT IF: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions explains the laws of science in operation in a way that every intelligent reader will enjoy and feel much the smarter for having read.","['Nonfiction', 'Science', 'Humor', 'Audiobook', 'Science', 'Physics']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1451351509l/21413662._SX318_.jpg,,,Mariner Books

In the dead systems where gates lead to stranger things than alien planets, Elvi Okoye begins a desperate search to discover the nature of a genocide that happened before the first human beings existed, and to find weapons to fight a war against forces at the edge of the imaginable. But the price of that knowledge may be higher than she can pay.
At the heart of the empire, Teresa Duarte prepares to take on the burden of her father's godlike ambition. The sociopathic scientist Paolo Cortázar and the Mephistophelian prisoner James Holden are only two of the dangers in a palace thick with intrigue, but Teresa has a mind of her own and secrets even her father the emperor doesn't guess.

NOW A MAJOR TV SERIES
A revolution brewing for generations has begun in fire. It will end in blood.
The Free Navy - a violent group of Belters in black-market military ships - has crippled the Earth and begun a campaign of piracy and violence among the outer planets. The colony ships heading for the thousand new worlds on the far side of the alien ring gates are easy prey, and no single navy remains strong enough to protect them.
James Holden and his crew know the strengths and weaknesses of this new force better than anyone. Outnumbered and outgunned, the embattled remnants of the old political powers call on the Rocinante for a desperate mission to reach Medina Station at the heart of the gate network.
But the new alliances are as flawed as the old, and the struggle for power has only just begun. As the chaos grows, an alien mystery deepens. Pirate fleets, mutiny and betrayal may be the least of the Rocinante's problems. And in the uncanny spaces past the ring gates, the choices of a few damaged and desperate people may determine the fate of more than just humanity.

You can alter someone’s feelings—and memories—but manipulating shadows has a cost, with the potential to take hours or days from your life. Your shadow holds all the parts of you that you want to keep hidden—a second self, standing just to your left, walking behind you into lit rooms. And sometimes, it has a life of its own.
Charlie is a low-level con artist, working as a bartender while trying to distance herself from the powerful and dangerous underground world of shadow trading. She gets by doing odd jobs for her patrons and the naive new money in her town at the edge of the Berkshires. But when a terrible figure from her past returns, Charlie’s present life is thrown into chaos, and her future seems at best, unclear—and at worst, non-existent. Determined to survive, Charlie throws herself into a maelstrom of secrets and murder, setting her against a cast of doppelgängers, mercurial billionaires, shadow thieves, and her own sister—all desperate to control the magic of the shadows.

It is the technology behind photo tagging systems at Facebook and Google, self-driving cars, speech recognition systems on your smartphone, and much more.
In particular, Deep learning excels at solving machine perception problems: understanding the content of image data, video data, or sound data. Here's a simple example: say you have a large collection of images, and that you want tags associated with each image, for example, ""dog,"" ""cat,"" etc. Deep learning can allow you to create a system that understands how to map such tags to images, learning only from examples. This system can then be applied to new images, automating the task of photo tagging.

Python 3 Object-oriented Programming: Building robust and maintainable software with object oriented design patterns in Python,Dusty Phillips,,,462,4.02,216,2010-07-26,2021-11-29,,Python 3 Object-oriented Programming: Building robust and maintainable software with object oriented design patterns in Python,Standalone,1,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26241635,"Unleash the power of Python 3 objects
About This Book Stop writing scripts and start architecting programs Learn the latest Python syntax and libraries A practical, hands-on tutorial that teaches you all about abstract design patterns and how to implement them in Python 3 Who This Book Is For
If you're new to object-oriented programming techniques, or if you have basic Python skills and wish to learn in depth how and when to correctly apply object-oriented programming in Python to design software, this is the book for you.
What You Will Learn Implement objects in Python by creating classes and defining methods Separate related objects into a taxonomy of classes and describe the properties and behaviors of those objects via the class interface Extend class functionality using inheritance Understand when to use object-oriented features, and more importantly when not to use them Discover what design patterns are and why they are different in Python Uncover the simplicity of unit testing and why it's so important in Python Grasp common concurrency techniques and pitfalls in Python 3 Exploit object-oriented programming in key Python technologies such as Kivy and Django. Object-oriented programming concurrently with asyncio In Detail
Python 3 is more versatile and easier to use than ever. It runs on all major platforms in a huge array of use cases. Coding in Python minimizes development time and increases productivity in comparison to other languages. Clean, maintainable code is easy to both read and write using Python's clear, concise syntax.
Object-oriented programming is a popular design paradigm in which data and behaviors are encapsulated in such a way that they can be manipulated together. Many modern programming languages utilize the powerful concepts behind object-oriented programming and Python is no exception.
Starting with a detailed analysis of object-oriented analysis and design, you will use the Python programming language to clearly grasp key concepts from the object-oriented paradigm. This book fully explains classes, data encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and exceptions with an emphasis on when you can use each principle to develop well-designed software.
You'll get an in-depth analysis of many common object-oriented design patterns that are more suitable to Python's unique style. This book will not just teach Python syntax, but will also build your confidence in how to program.
You will also learn how to create maintainable applications by studying higher level design patterns. Following this, you'll learn the complexities of string and file manipulation, and how Python distinguishes between binary and textual data. Not one, but two very powerful automated testing systems will be introduced in the book. After you discover the joy of unit testing and just how easy it can be, you'll study higher level libraries such as database connectors and GUI toolkits and learn how they uniquely apply object-oriented principles. You'll learn how these principles will allow you to make greater use of key members of the Python eco-system such as Django and Kivy.
This new edition includes all the topics that made Python 3 Object-oriented Programming an instant Packt classic. It’s also packed with updated content to reflect recent changes in the core Python library and covers modern third-party packages that were not available on the Python 3 platform when the book was first published.

Like their father, the twins possess supernormal abilities--making them valuable to their manipulative aunt Alia, who rules the Empire in the name of House Atreides.
Facing treason and rebellion on two fronts, Alia's rule is not absolute. The displaced House Corrino is plotting to regain the throne while the fanatical Fremen are being provoked into open revolt by the enigmatic figure known only as The Preacher.

Many investors, including some with substantial portfolios, have only the sketchiest idea of how the stock market works. The reason, say Lynch and Rothchild, is that the basics of investing—the fundamentals of our economic system and what they have to do with the stock market—aren’t taught in school. At a time when individuals have to make important decisions about saving for college and 401(k) retirement funds, this failure to provide a basic education in investing can have tragic consequences.
For those who know what to look for, investment opportunities are everywhere. The average high school student is familiar with Nike, Reebok, McDonald’s, the Gap, and The Body Shop. Nearly every teenager in America drinks Coke or Pepsi, but only a very few own shares in either company or even understand how to buy them. Every student studies American history, but few realize that our country was settled by European colonists financed by public companies in England and Holland—and the basic principles behind public companies haven’t changed in more than three hundred years.
In Learn to Earn, Lynch and Rothchild explain in a style accessible to anyone who is high school age or older how to read a stock table in the daily newspaper, how to understand a company annual report, and why everyone should pay attention to the stock market. They explain not only how to invest, but also how to think like an investor.","['Economics', 'Finance', 'Business', 'Nonfiction', 'Economics', 'Currency']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1395629340l/817589.jpg,"{'1x': [], '1.5x': [], '2x': [], '2.5x': [], '3x': [], '3.5x': [], '4x': []}",[],Simon  Schuster

And Earth is poor, with great areas of radioactivity ruining much of its soil--so poor that everyone is sentenced to death at the age of sixty.
Joseph Schwartz is sixty-two.

What’s more, she traveled light-years from home as an undercover spy to infiltrate the Superiority, where she learned of the galaxy beyond her small, desolate planet home.
Now, the Superiority—the governing galactic alliance bent on dominating all human life—has started a galaxy-wide war. And Spensa has seen the weapons they plan to use to end it: the Delvers. Ancient, mysterious alien forces that can wipe out entire planetary systems in an instant. Spensa knows that no matter how many pilots the DDF has, there is no defeating this predator.
Except that Spensa is Cytonic. She faced down a Delver and saw something eerily familiar about it. And maybe, if she’s able to figure out what she is, she could be more than just another pilot in this unfolding war. She could save the galaxy.

“Don’t trust their lies. Don’t trust their false peace.” That is the warning that Alanik of the planet ReDawn gave the human pilot Spensa after Alanik’s ship crash-landed on Detritus. While accepting an invitation to meet with her people’s enemy, the Galactic Superiority, Alanik heard Spensa’s cry for help across the vastness of space, and she used her cytonic powers to hyperjump her ship to the source of that cry. What she found there was a shock—a whole planet of free humans fighting against the Superiority. Were they the allies her people desperately needed?
When she recovered from her injuries and met the friendly humans Jorgen and FM of Skyward Flight, she found that her warning to Spensa had gone unheeded by the government of Detritus, and they were considering a peace overture from the Superiority. Now having returned to ReDawn, Alanik is dismayed to learn that her own people are falling into the exact same trap.
The faction in ReDawn’s government that wants to appease the Superiority has gained the upper hand. With Alanik’s mentor, Renakin captured, she has no one to turn to but Jorgen, FM, and their friend Rig.

Even the imperial legions, long inured to the bloodshed, yearn for some respite. Yet Empress Laseen's rule remains absolute, enforced by her dread Claw assassins.
For Sergeant Whiskeyjack and his squad of Bridgeburners, and for Tattersail, surviving cadre mage of the Second Legion, the aftermath of the siege of Pale should have been a time to mourn the many dead. But Darujhistan, last of the Free Cities of Genabackis, yet holds out. It is to this ancient citadel that Laseen turns her predatory gaze.
However, it would appear that the Empire is not alone in this great game. Sinister, shadowbound forces are gathering as the gods themselves prepare to play their hand...

Einstein himself said it was “the most valuable theory of my life,” and “of incomparable beauty.” It describes the evolution of the universe, black holes, the behavior of orbiting neutron stars, and why clocks run slower on the surface of the earth than in space. It even suggests the possibility of time travel.
And yet when we think of Einstein's breakthrough year, we think instead of 1905, the year of Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity and his equation E=mc2, as his annus mirabilis, even though the Special Theory has a narrower focus.
Today the General Theory is overshadowed by these achievements, regarded as 'too difficult' for ordinary mortals to comprehend. In Einstein's Masterwork, John Gribbin puts Einstein's astonishing breakthrough in the context of his life and work, and makes it clear why his greatest year was indeed 1915 and his General Theory his true masterpiece.","['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'Science', 'Physics', 'History', 'Biography']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1455904002l/28943755.jpg,"{'1x': [], '1.5x': [], '2x': [], '2.5x': [], '3x': [], '3.5x': [], '4x': []}",[],

The twentieth century gave us two great theories of physics. The general theory of relativity describes the behavior of very large things, and quantum theory the behavior of very small things. In this landmark book, John Gribbin—one of the best-known science writers of the past thirty years—presents his own version of the Holy Grail of physics, the search that has been going on for decades to find a unified “Theory of Everything” that combines these ideas into one mathematical package, a single equation that could be printed on a T-shirt, containing the answer to life, the Universe, and everything. With his inimitable mixture of science, history, and biography, Gribbin shows how—despite skepticism among many physicists—these two great theories are very compatible, and point to a deep truth about the nature of our existence. The answer lies, intriguingly, with the age of the universe: 13.8 billion years.","['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'Science', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Astronomy']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1448570927l/26196560.jpg,,,Yale University Press

Pioneering physicists are on the brink of unlocking a new quantum universe which provides a better representation of reality than our everyday experiences and common sense ever could. The birth of quantum computers – which, like Schrödinger’s famous ‘dead and alive’ cat, rely on entities like electrons, photons or atoms existing in two states at the same time – is set to turn the computing world on its head.


In his fascinating study of this cutting-edge technology, John Gribbin updates his previous views on the nature of quantum reality, arguing for a universe of many parallel worlds where ‘everything is real’. Looking back to Alan Turing’s work on the Enigma machine and the first electronic computer, Gribbin explains how quantum theory developed to make quantum computers work in practice as well as in principle. He takes us beyond the arena of theoretical physics to explore their practical applications – from machines which learn through ‘intuition’ and trial and error to unhackable laptops and smartphones. And he investigates the potential for this extraordinary science to create a world where communication occurs faster than light and teleportation is possible.","['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'Science', 'Physics', 'Computer Science', 'Computers']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1394419211l/17999205.jpg,,,Bantam Press
The Time Illusion (Kindle Single),John Gribbin,,,35,4.08,540,,,,The Time Illusion,Standalone,1,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31311948,"Albert Einstein said “the distinction between past, present, and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion”. So, why do we perceive a flow of time? Is the future “already there”, and is the past “still there”, even though we are only aware of a single moment of time?
Drawing on the latest ideas from both relativity and quantum theory, award-winning science writer John Gribbin (In Search of Schrödinger’s Cat) addresses the questions that have baffled philosophers since antiquity and Zeno’s arrow paradox. Along the way, we find that in the quantum world it is literally true that a watched pot never boils, and learn how physicists have come to terms with the idea of the four-dimensional block universe as an explanation of the distinction between past, present and future.
Why do eggs break when we drop them, but never unbreak? The Universe as we know it began in a Big Bang, which in some sense marks the beginning of time. Is it possible that we need to invoke the Big Bang to explain why we never see unbroken eggs? This idea glories in the name “the past hypothesis”, but many physicists regard it as no more than an attempt to sweep the problem of the arrow of time under the rug.

Now astrophysicist John Gribbin draws on his expertise to explore, in prose that communicates not only the wonder but the substance of cutting-edge science, the principles behind chaos and complexity. He reveals the remarkable ways these two revolutionary theories have been applied over the last twenty years to explain all sorts of phenomena–from weather patterns to mass extinctions.
Grounding these paradigm-shifting ideas in their historical context, Gribbin also traces their development from Newton to Darwin to Lorenz, Prigogine, and Lovelock, demonstrating how–far from overturning all that has gone before–chaos and complexity are the triumphant extensions of simple scientific laws. Ultimately, Gribbin illustrates how chaos and complexity permeate the universe on every scale, governing the evolution of life and galaxies alike.","['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'Science', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Mathematics']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388373561l/587906.jpg,"{'1x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-4ZHFNF1L._AC_UY218_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-4ZHFNF1L._AC_UY654_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '1.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-4ZHFNF1L._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91G-oxOil+L._AC_UY218_.jpg'], '2x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-4ZHFNF1L._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91G-oxOil+L._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '2.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-4ZHFNF1L._AC_UY545_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91G-oxOil+L._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '3x': [], '3.5x': [], '4x': []}",['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-4ZHFNF1L.jpg'],Random House

In this ambitious new book, John Gribbin tells the stories of the people who have made science, and of the times in which they lived and worked. He begins with Copernicus, during the Renaissance, when science replaced mysticism as a means of explaining the workings of the world, and he continues through the centuries, creating an unbroken genealogy of not only the greatest but also the more obscure names of Western science, a dot-to-dot line linking amateur to genius, and accidental discovery to brilliant deduction.
By focusing on the scientists themselves, Gribbin has written an anecdotal narrative enlivened with stories of personal drama, success and failure. A bestselling science writer with an international reputation, Gribbin is among the few authors who could even attempt a work of this magnitude. Praised as “a sequence of witty, information-packed tales” and “a terriﬁ c read” by The Times upon its recent British publication, The Scientists breathes new life into such venerable icons as Galileo, Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein and Linus Pauling, as well as lesser lights whose stories have been undeservedly neglected. Filled with pioneers, visionaries, eccentrics and madmen, this is the history of science as it has never been told before.

Published in 1854, the story concerns one Thomas Gradgrind, a ""fanatic of the demonstrable fact,"" who raises his children, Tom and Louisa, in a stifling and arid atmosphere of grim practicality.
Without a moral compass to guide them, the children sink into lives of desperation and despair, played out against the grim background of Coketown, a wretched community shadowed by an industrial behemoth. Louisa falls into a loveless marriage with Josiah Bouderby, a vulgar banker, while the unscrupulous Tom, totally lacking in principle, becomes a thief who frames an innocent man for his crime. Witnessing the degradation and downfall of his children, Gradgrind realizes that his own misguided principles have ruined their lives.
Considered Dickens' harshest indictment of mid-19th-century industrial practices and their dehumanizing effects, this novel offers a fascinating tapestry of Victorian life, filled with the richness of detail, brilliant characterization, and passionate social concern that typify the novelist's finest creations.

The story of Oliver Twist - orphaned, and set upon by evil and adversity from his first breath - shocked readers when it was published. After running away from the workhouse and pompous beadle Mr Bumble, Oliver finds himself lured into a den of thieves peopled by vivid and memorable characters - the Artful Dodger, vicious burglar Bill Sikes, his dog Bull's Eye, and prostitute Nancy, all watched over by cunning master-thief Fagin. Combining elements of Gothic Romance, the Newgate Novel and popular melodrama, Dickens created an entirely new kind of fiction, scathing in its indictment of a cruel society, and pervaded by an unforgettable sense of threat and mystery.
This Penguin Classics edition of Oliver Twist is the first critical edition to faithfully reproduce the text as its earliest readers would have encountered it from its serialisation in Bentley's Miscellany, and includes an introduction by Philip Horne, a glossary of Victorian thieves' slang, a chronology of Dickens's life, a map of contemporary London and all of George Cruikshank's original illustrations.

The most famous and perhaps the most popular of his works, it compresses an event of immense complexity to the scale of a family history, with a cast of characters that includes a bloodthirsty ogress and an antihero as believably flawed as any in modern fiction. Though the least typical of the author’s novels, A Tale of Two Cities still underscores many of his enduring themes—imprisonment, injustice, social anarchy, resurrection, and the renunciation that fosters renewal.","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literature', 'Historical']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1344922523l/1953.jpg,"{'1x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91eLUjyFgOL._AC_UY218_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91eLUjyFgOL._AC_UY654_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71mhSXizccL._AC_UY545_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '1.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91eLUjyFgOL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71mhSXizccL._AC_UY218_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71mhSXizccL._AC_UY654_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '2x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91eLUjyFgOL._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71mhSXizccL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81mZC2xneHS._AC_UY218_.jpg'], '2.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91eLUjyFgOL._AC_UY545_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71mhSXizccL._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81mZC2xneHS._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '3x': [], '3.5x': [], '4x': []}","['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91eLUjyFgOL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81bsZxY+pgL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71dvVQx5dbL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71RIrOF8ScL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81uQIG7qzGL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91GC192xIvL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81TQpD7s+JL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91bCQ2oxKmL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/819neVe1wlL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71mhSXizccL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71XBK72Z4yL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81mZC2xneHS.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91Uv6QuFdUS.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81xAueFzHZS.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ABzCMrF9S.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Mk1D9A0aS.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81QN89I8QFS.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81e4nzDFpnS.jpg']",Penguin Books

But no battle is won alone, and before the Reds may rise as one, Mare must side with the boy who broke her heart in order to defeat the boy who almost broke her.

Prepare for the thrilling finale in the epic, best-selling Aurora Cycle series about a band of unlikely heroes who just might be the galaxy's last hope for survival.
Is this the end?
What happens when you ask a bunch of losers, discipline cases, and misfits to save the galaxy from an ancient evil? The ancient evil wins, of course.
Wait. . . . Not. So. Fast.
When we last saw Squad 312, they were working together seamlessly (aka, freaking out) as an intergalactic battle raged and an ancient superweapon threatened to obliterate Earth. Everything went horribly wrong, naturally.
But as it turns out, not all endings are endings, and the team has one last chance to rewrite theirs. Maybe two. It's complicated.
Cue Zila, Fin, and Scarlett (and MAGELLAN!): making friends, making enemies, and making history? Sure, no problem.
Cue Tyler, Kal, and Auri: uniting with two of the galaxy’s most hated villains? Um, okay. That, too.
Actually saving the galaxy, though?

First, the bad news: an ancient evil—you know, your standard consume-all-life-in-the-galaxy deal—is about to be unleashed. The good news? Squad 312 is standing by to save the day. They’ve just got to take care of a few small distractions first.
Like the clan of gremps who’d like to rearrange their favorite faces.
And the cadre of illegit GIA agents with creepy flowers where their eyes used to be, who’ll stop at nothing to get their hands on Auri.
Then there’s Kal’s long-lost sister, who’s not exactly happy to see her baby brother, and has a Syldrathi army at her back. With half the known galaxy on their tails, Squad 312 has never felt so wanted.
When they learn the Hadfield has been found, it’s time to come out of hiding. Two centuries ago, the colony ship vanished, leaving Auri as its sole survivor. Now, its black box might be what saves them. But time is short, and if Auri can’t learn to master her powers as a Trigger, the squad and all their admirers are going to be deader than the Great Ultrasaur of Abraaxis IV.
Shocking revelations, bank heists, mysterious gifts, inappropriately tight bodysuits, and an epic firefight will determine the fate of the Aurora Legion’s most unforgettable heroes—and maybe the rest of the galaxy as well.","['Science Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Fantasy', 'Romance', 'Audiobook']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1574498270l/40516960.jpg,"{'1x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/519FCkOOYRL._AC_UY218_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/519FCkOOYRL._AC_UY500_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ak4DBpIpL._AC_UY545_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '1.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/519FCkOOYRL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ak4DBpIpL._AC_UY218_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ak4DBpIpL._AC_UY654_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '2x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/519FCkOOYRL._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ak4DBpIpL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61kCfD5R8PL._AC_UY218_.jpg'], '2.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ak4DBpIpL._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61kCfD5R8PL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '3x': [], '3.5x': [], '4x': []}","['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/519FCkOOYRL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ak4DBpIpL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61kCfD5R8PL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/519FCkOOYRL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81vRz5AdpmL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91XbN+bLNDL.jpg']",

Dodging flaming monkey poo, for instance. Or going toe-to-leaf with a walking plant monster. Still, there is something more troubling than usual about his newest case. The film's producer believes he's the target of a sinister entropy curse, but it's the women around him who are dying, in increasingly spectacular ways.
Harry is doubly frustrated because he got involved with this bizarre mystery only as a favor to Thomas, his flirtatious, self-absorbed vampire acquaintance of dubious integrity. Thomas has a personal stake in the case Harry can't quite figure out, until his investigation leads him straight to Thomas' oversexed vampire family. Harry is about to discover that Thomas' family tree has been hiding a shocking secret; a revelation that will change Harry's life forever.

It should have taken Juliette a single touch to kill Warner. But his mysterious immunity to her deadly power has left her shaken, wondering why her ultimate defense mechanism failed against the person she most needs protection from.
She and Adam were able to escape Warner’s clutches and join up with a group of rebels, many of whom have powers of their own. Juliette will finally be able to actively fight against The Reestablishment and try to fix her broken world. And perhaps these new allies can help her shed light on the secret behind Adam’s—and Warner’s—immunity to her killer skin.

Adelina Amouteru is a survivor of the blood fever. A decade ago, the deadly illness swept through her nation. Most of the infected perished, while many of the children who survived were left with strange markings. Adelina’s black hair turned silver, her lashes went pale, and now she has only a jagged scar where her left eye once was. Her cruel father believes she is a malfetto, an abomination, ruining their family’s good name and standing in the way of their fortune. But some of the fever’s survivors are rumored to possess more than just scars—they are believed to have mysterious and powerful gifts, and though their identities remain secret, they have come to be called the Young Elites.
Teren Santoro works for the king. As Leader of the Inquisition Axis, it is his job to seek out the Young Elites, to destroy them before they destroy the nation. He believes the Young Elites to be dangerous and vengeful, but it’s Teren who may possess the darkest secret of all.
Enzo Valenciano is a member of the Dagger Society. This secret sect of Young Elites seeks out others like them before the Inquisition Axis can. But when the Daggers find Adelina, they discover someone with powers like they’ve never seen.
Adelina wants to believe Enzo is on her side, and that Teren is the true enemy. But the lives of these three will collide in unexpected ways, as each fights a very different and personal battle. But of one thing they are all certain: Adelina has abilities that shouldn’t belong in this world. A vengeful blackness in her heart. And a desire to destroy all who dare to cross her.

It is called Le Cirque des Rêves, and it is only open at night.
But behind the scenes, a fierce competition is underway—a duel between two young magicians, Celia and Marco, who have been trained since childhood expressly for this purpose by their mercurial instructors. Unbeknownst to them, this is a game in which only one can be left standing, and the circus is but the stage for a remarkable battle of imagination and will. Despite themselves, however, Celia and Marco tumble headfirst into love—a deep, magical love that makes the lights flicker and the room grow warm whenever they so much as brush hands.
True love or not, the game must play out, and the fates of everyone involved, from the cast of extraordinary circus performers to the patrons, hang in the balance, suspended as precariously as the daring acrobats overhead.

In Letherii, the exiled Malazan army commanded by Adjunct Tavore begins its march into the eastern Wastelands, to fight for an unknown cause against an enemy it has never seen.
And in these same Wastelands, others gather to confront their destinies. The warlike Barghast, thwarted in their vengeance against the Tiste Edur, seek new enemies beyond the border and Onos Toolan, once immortal T'lan Imass now mortal commander of the White Face clan, faces insurrection. To the south, the Perish Grey Helms parlay passage through the treacherous kingdom of Bolkando. Their intention is to rendezvous with the Bonehunters but their vow of allegiance to the Malazans will be sorely tested. And ancient enclaves of an Elder Race are in search of salvation--not among their own kind, but among humans--as an old enemy draws ever closer to the last surviving bastion of the K'Chain Che'Malle.
So this last great army of the Malazan Empire is resolved to make one final defiant, heroic stand in the name of redemption. But can deeds be heroic when there is no one to witness them? And can that which is not witnessed forever change the world? Destines are rarely simple, truths never clear but one certainty is that time is on no one's side.

Sha'ik is dead. One last rebel force remains, holed up in the city of Y'Ghatan and under the fanatical command of Leoman of the Flails. The prospect of laying siege to this ancient fortress makes the battle-weary Malaz 14th Army uneasy.

How do you defend a city surrounded by enemies and riddled with traitors, when your allies can by no means be trusted, and your predecessor vanished without a trace? It’s enough to make a torturer want to run – if he could even walk without a stick.
Northmen have spilled over the border of Angland and are spreading fire and death across the frozen country. Crown Prince Ladisla is poised to drive them back and win undying glory. There is only one problem – he commands the worst-armed, worst-trained, worst-led army in the world.
And Bayaz, the First of the Magi, is leading a party of bold adventurers on a perilous mission through the ruins of the past. The most hated woman in the South, the most feared man in the North, and the most selfish boy in the Union make a strange alliance, but a deadly one. They might even stand a chance of saving mankind from the Eaters. If they didn’t hate each other quite so much.
Ancient secrets will be uncovered. Bloody battles will be won and lost. Bitter enemies will be forgiven – but not before they are hanged.

Caught in one feud too many, he’s on the verge of becoming a dead barbarian – leaving nothing behind him but bad songs, dead friends, and a lot of happy enemies.
Nobleman Captain Jezal dan Luthar, dashing officer, and paragon of selfishness, has nothing more dangerous in mind than fleecing his friends at cards and dreaming of glory in the fencing circle. But war is brewing, and on the battlefields of the frozen North they fight by altogether bloodier rules.
Inquisitor Glokta, cripple turned torturer, would like nothing better than to see Jezal come home in a box. But then Glokta hates everyone: cutting treason out of the Union one confession at a time leaves little room for friendship. His latest trail of corpses may lead him right to the rotten heart of government, if he can stay alive long enough to follow it.
Enter the wizard, Bayaz. A bald old man with a terrible temper and a pathetic assistant, he could be the First of the Magi, he could be a spectacular fraud, but whatever he is, he's about to make the lives of Logen, Jezal, and Glokta a whole lot more difficult.
Murderous conspiracies rise to the surface, old scores are ready to be settled, and the line between hero and villain is sharp enough to draw blood.

By age twenty, in fact, she is the sole survivor of a horrific, unsolved multiple homicide. Some might say she’s thrown her life away. But at her hospital bed, Alex is offered a second chance: to attend one of the world’s most elite universities on a full ride. What’s the catch, and why her?
Still searching for answers to this herself, Alex arrives in New Haven tasked by her mysterious benefactors with monitoring the activities of Yale’s secret societies. These eight windowless “tombs” are well-known to be haunts of the future rich and powerful, from high-ranking politicos to Wall Street and Hollywood’s biggest players.

On Christmas Eve, Sadie and Carter are reunited when their father brings them to the British Museum, with a promise that he's going to ""make things right."" But all does not go according to plan: Carter and Sadie watch as Julius summons a mysterious figure, who quickly banishes their father and causes a fiery explosion.
Soon Carter and Sadie discover that the gods of Ancient Egypt are waking, and the worst of them—Set—has a frightening scheme. To save their father, they must embark on a dangerous journey—a quest that brings them ever closer to the truth about their family and its links to the House of Life, a secret order that has existed since the time of the pharaohs.","['Fantasy', 'Young Adult', 'Fantasy', 'Mythology', 'Childrens', 'Middle Grade']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1366227978l/7090447.jpg,"{'1x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ZhFqR104L._AC_UY218_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ZhFqR104L._AC_UY654_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/6135r+8qs1L._AC_UY545_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '1.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ZhFqR104L._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/6135r+8qs1L._AC_UY218_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/6135r+8qs1L._AC_UY654_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '2x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ZhFqR104L._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/6135r+8qs1L._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Fmrh9kr5L._AC_UY218_.jpg'], '2.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ZhFqR104L._AC_UY545_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/6135r+8qs1L._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Fmrh9kr5L._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '3x': [], '3.5x': [], '4x': []}","['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/6135r+8qs1L.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91E4T1NSnTL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81llDCNgKCL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31KFA9y6lfL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91tJAt3Yk7L.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51QtiHviIFL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91nEz7f6QpL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61aGqaqEOBS.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ExUtotTXS.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Fmrh9kr5L.jpg']",Disney-Hyperion

When he awoke from his long sleep, he didn't know much more than his name. His brain fuzz is lingering, even after the wolf Lupa told him he is a demigod and trained him to fight with the pen/sword in his pocket. Somehow Percy manages to make it to a camp for half-bloods, despite the fact that he has to keep killing monsters along the way. But the camp doesn't ring any bells with him. The only thing he can recall from his past is another name: Annabeth.
HAZEL IS SUPPOSED TO BE DEAD. When she lived before, she didn't do a very good job of it. Sure, she was an obedient daughter, even when her mother was possessed by greed. But that was the problem—when the Voice took over her mother and commanded Hazel to use her ""gift"" for an evil purpose, Hazel couldn't say no. Now because of her mistake, the future of the world is at risk. Hazel wishes she could ride away from it all on the stallion that appears in her dreams.
FRANK IS A KLUTZ. His grandmother says he is descended from heroes and can be anything he wants to be, but he doesn't see it. He doesn't even know who his father is. He keeps hoping Apollo will claim him, because the only thing he is good at is archery—although not good enough to win camp war games. His bulky physique makes him feel like an ox, especially in front of Hazel, his closest friend at camp. He trusts her completely—enough to share the secret he holds close to his heart.
Beginning at the ""other"" camp for half-bloods and extending as far as the land beyond the gods, this breathtaking second installment of the Heroes of Olympus series introduces new demigods, revives fearsome monsters, and features other remarkable creatures, all destined to play a part in the Prophesy of Seven.","['Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Mythology', 'Young Adult', 'Fiction', 'Childrens']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1464201114l/9520360._SY475_.jpg,"{'1x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91gToMO3JRL._AC_UY218_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91gToMO3JRL._AC_UY654_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61+P8lV+-gL._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '1.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91gToMO3JRL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61+P8lV+-gL._AC_UY218_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61+P8lV+-gL._AC_UY500_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '2x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91gToMO3JRL._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61+P8lV+-gL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/A1sGWyidMQL._AC_UY218_.jpg'], '2.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91gToMO3JRL._AC_UY545_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/A1sGWyidMQL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '3x': [], '3.5x': [], '4x': []}","['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91gToMO3JRL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61+P8lV+-gL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1sGWyidMQL.jpg']",Disney-Hyperion Books

“I have no doubt this will end up being the best fantasy debut of the year [...] I have absolutely no doubt that [Kuang’s] name will be up there with the likes of Robin Hobb and N.K. Jemisin.” -- Booknest
A brilliantly imaginative talent makes her exciting debut with this epic historical military fantasy, inspired by the bloody history of China’s twentieth century and filled with treachery and magic, in the tradition of Ken Liu’s Grace of Kings and N.K. Jemisin’s Inheritance Trilogy.
When Rin aced the Keju—the Empire-wide test to find the most talented youth to learn at the Academies—it was a shock to everyone: to the test officials, who couldn’t believe a war orphan from Rooster Province could pass without cheating; to Rin’s guardians, who believed they’d finally be able to marry her off and further their criminal enterprise; and to Rin herself, who realized she was finally free of the servitude and despair that had made up her daily existence. That she got into Sinegard—the most elite military school in Nikan—was even more surprising.
But surprises aren’t always good.
Because being a dark-skinned peasant girl from the south is not an easy thing at Sinegard. Targeted from the outset by rival classmates for her color, poverty, and gender, Rin discovers she possesses a lethal, unearthly power—an aptitude for the nearly-mythical art of shamanism. Exploring the depths of her gift with the help of a seemingly insane teacher and psychoactive substances, Rin learns that gods long thought dead are very much alive—and that mastering control over those powers could mean more than just surviving school.
For while the Nikara Empire is at peace, the Federation of Mugen still lurks across a narrow sea. The militarily advanced Federation occupied Nikan for decades after the First Poppy War, and only barely lost the continent in the Second. And while most of the people are complacent to go about their lives, a few are aware that a Third Poppy War is just a spark away . . .
Rin’s shamanic powers may be the only way to save her people. But as she finds out more about the god that has chosen her, the vengeful Phoenix, she fears that winning the war may cost her humanity . . . and that it may already be too late.","['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Historical Fiction', 'Adult', 'Historical']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1515691735l/35068705.jpg,"{'1x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81UPas8SeAL._AC_UY218_.jpg'], '1.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81UPas8SeAL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '2x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81UPas8SeAL._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '2.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81UPas8SeAL._AC_UY545_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '3x': [], '3.5x': [], '4x': []}",['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81UPas8SeAL.jpg'],Harper Voyager

In the aftermath of the Third Poppy War, shaman and warrior Rin is on the run: haunted by the atrocity she committed to end the war, addicted to opium, and hiding from the murderous commands of her vengeful god, the fiery Phoenix. Her only reason for living is to get revenge on the traitorous Empress who sold out Nikan to their enemies.
With no other options, Rin joins forces with the powerful Dragon Warlord, who has a plan to conquer Nikan, unseat the Empress, and create a new Republic. Rin throws herself into his war. After all, making war is all she knows how to do.
But the Empress is a more powerful foe than she appears, and the Dragon Warlord’s motivations are not as democratic as they seem. The more Rin learns, the more she fears her love for Nikan will drive her away from every ally and lead her to rely more and more on the Phoenix’s deadly power. Because there is nothing she won’t sacrifice for her country and her vengeance.

He was a great teacher, a born showman, bongo drummer, buffoon & iconoclast; a scientific magician capable of transcendental leaps of the imagination. During his career he was drawn into research on the atomic bomb before working out his path-integral formulation of quantum mechanics & quantum electro-dynamics. Subsequently he developed the diagrammatic technique, as a result of which Feynman diagrams became ubiquitous in quantum field theory, elementary particle physics & statistical mechanics. From 1950 he was based at the California Institute of Technology, where he worked on the superfluidity of liquid helium, the theory of polarons, the theory of weak interactions, the quantum theory of gravitation, partons, quark jets & the limits of computation. He'd a unified view of physics & nature. He took the whole of nature as the arena of his science & imagination. Jagdish Mehra personally knew Feynman for 30 years. In 1980 Feynman suggested he might do what he had already done for Heisenberg, Pauli & Dirac, that is write a definitive account of his life, science & personality. Mehra instantly agreed & subsequently spent several weeks talking to him. After Feynman's death Mehra interviewed almost 80 people who'd known him & aspects of his work. This book draws on this unique material & on Feynman's remarkable writings. It covers his childhood, his three marriages, his extraordinary range of interests. But most important, it deals with his scientific work in far greater detail than in any other biographical work. What has emerged is an authoritative account of Feynman's life & achievements.","['Biography', 'Science', 'Physics', 'Science', 'History', 'Nonfiction']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1186699756l/1676740._SY475_.jpg,"{'1x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51QFFjVKhXL._AC_UY218_.jpg'], '1.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51QFFjVKhXL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '2x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51QFFjVKhXL._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '2.5x': [], '3x': [], '3.5x': [], '4x': []}",['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51QFFjVKhXL.jpg'],"Oxford University Press, USA"

In Physics of the Future, Michio Kaku—the New York Times bestselling author of Physics of the Impossible—gives us a stunning, provocative, and exhilarating vision of the coming century based on interviews with over three hundred of the world's top scientists who are already inventing the future in their labs. The result is the most authoritative and scientifically accurate description of the revolutionary developments taking place in medicine, computers, artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, energy production, and astronautics.
In all likelihood, by 2100 we will control computers via tiny brain sensors and, like magicians, move objects around with the power of our minds. Artificial intelligence will be dispersed throughout the environment, and Internet-enabled contact lenses will allow us to access the world's information base or conjure up any image we desire in the blink of an eye.
Meanwhile, cars will drive themselves using GPS, and if room-temperature superconductors are discovered, vehicles will effortlessly fly on a cushion of air, coasting on powerful magnetic fields and ushering in the age of magnetism.
Using molecular medicine, scientists will be able to grow almost every organ of the body and cure genetic diseases. Millions of tiny DNA sensors and nanoparticles patrolling our blood cells will silently scan our bodies for the first sign of illness, while rapid advances in genetic research will enable us to slow down or maybe even reverse the aging process, allowing human life spans to increase dramatically.
In space, radically new ships—needle-sized vessels using laser propulsion—could replace the expensive chemical rockets of today and perhaps visit nearby stars. Advances in nanotechnology may lead to the fabled space elevator, which would propel humans hundreds of miles above the earth's atmosphere at the push of a button.
But these astonishing revelations are only the tip of the iceberg. Kaku also discusses emotional robots, antimatter rockets, X-ray vision, and the ability to create new life-forms, and he considers the development of the world economy. He addresses the key questions: Who are the winner and losers of the future? Who will have jobs, and which nations will prosper?
All the while, Kaku illuminates the rigorous scientific principles, examining the rate at which certain technologies are likely to mature, how far they can advance, and what their ultimate limitations and hazards are. Synthesizing a vast amount of information to construct an exciting look at the years leading up to 2100, Physics of the Future is a thrilling, wondrous ride through the next 100 years of breathtaking scientific revolution.

Are there gateways to parallel universes? What happened before the first day of Creation? These types of questions are at the center of current scientific activity. Indeed, many physicists today believe that there are other dimensions beyond the four of our space-time, and that a unified vision of the various forces of nature can be achieved, if we consider that everything we see around us, from the trees to the stars are nothing but vibrations in hyperspace. Hyperspace theory - and its more recent derivation, superstring theory - is the eye of this revolution. In this book, Michio Kaku shows us a fascinating panorama, which completely changes our view of the cosmos, and takes us on a dazzling journey through new dimensions: wormholes connecting parallel universes, time machines, ""baby universes"" and more.

The book covers a broad range of topics, comprising Sagan's reflections on anthropological, cosmological, biological, historical, and astronomical matters from antiquity to contemporary times. Sagan reiterates his position on extraterrestrial life—that the magnitude of the universe permits the existence of thousands of alien civilizations, but no credible evidence exists to demonstrate that such life has ever visited earth.","['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'Science', 'Astronomy', 'Science', 'Physics']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388620656l/55030.jpg,"{'1x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31mieaD-UXL._AC_UY218_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31mieaD-UXL._AC_UY500_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/514wnSZf8SL._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '1.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31mieaD-UXL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/514wnSZf8SL._AC_UY218_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/514wnSZf8SL._AC_UY500_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '2x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31mieaD-UXL._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/514wnSZf8SL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61D61dywROL._AC_UY218_.jpg'], '2.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61D61dywROL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '3x': [], '3.5x': [], '4x': []}","['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31mieaD-UXL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/514wnSZf8SL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61D61dywROL.jpg']",Random House

Taking as territory everything from the Big Bang to the rise of civilization, Bryson seeks to understand how we got from there being nothing at all to there being us. To that end, he has attached himself to a host of the world’s most advanced (and often obsessed) archaeologists, anthropologists, and mathematicians, travelling to their offices, laboratories, and field camps. He has read (or tried to read) their books, pestered them with questions, apprenticed himself to their powerful minds. A Short History of Nearly Everything is the record of this quest, and it is a sometimes profound, sometimes funny, and always supremely clear and entertaining adventure in the realms of human knowledge, as only Bill Bryson can render it.

Three hostelmates – Alok, Hari and Ryan get off to a bad start in IIT – they screw up the first class quiz. And while they try to make amends, things only get worse. It takes them a while to realize: If you try and screw with the IIT system, it comes back to double screw you. Before they know it, they are at the lowest echelons of IIT society.

This GPA is a tattoo that will remain with them, and come in the way of anything else that matters – their friendship, their future, their love life.

A superorganism, Gaia is a holistic planet with a common consciousness so intensely united that every dewdrop, every pebble, every being, can speak for all—and feel for all. It is a realm in which privacy is not only undesirable, it is incomprehensible.
But is it the right choice for the destiny of mankind? While Trevize feels it is, that is not enough. He must know.
Trevize believes the answer lies at the site of humanity's roots: fabled Earth . . . if it still exists. For no one is sure where the planet of Gaia's first settlers is to be found in the immense wilderness of the Galaxy. Nor can anyone explain why no record of Earth has been preserved, no mention of it made anywhere in Gaia's vast world-memory. It is an enigma Trevize is determined to resolve, and a quest he is determined to undertake, at any cost.

Gribbin takes infinitely complex, mind-bending experiments, brings them to life, and makes them accessible to the lay reader. Under his deft guidance, we can begin to grasp the fundamental riddle of today's quantum mechanics: how a single photon can be seen going in two directions at once. Along the way, Gribbin reveals some fascinating discoveries: how quantum particles could one day be used in a Star Trek-type teleportation system, and how quantum cryptographers have developed ways of making unbreakable codes using quantum effects.
Schrodinger's Kittens and the Search for Reality illuminates the world's most intriguing and enigmatic scientific phenomenon - and shows how the ""impossible dreams"" of such legendary scientists as Bohr, Feynman, and Einstein may soon become reality.

That edition was on the cutting edge of what was then known about the origins and nature of the universe. But the intervening years have seen extraordinary advances in the technology of observing both the micro- and the macrocosmic worlds. These observations have confirmed many of Professor Hawking's theoretical predictions in the first edition of his book, including the recent discoveries of the Cosmic Background Explorer satellite (COBE), which probed back in time to within 300,000 years of the universe's beginning and revealed wrinkles in the fabric of space-time that he had projected. Eager to bring to his original text the new knowledge revealed by these observations, as well as his own recent research, Professor Hawking has prepared a new introduction to the book, written an entirely new chapter on wormholes and time travel, and updated the chapters throughout.","['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'Science', 'Physics', 'History', 'Classics']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1333578746l/3869.jpg,"{'1x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81DBK93b6jL._AC_UY218_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81DBK93b6jL._AC_UY654_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ENubHA6NL._AC_UY545_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '1.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81DBK93b6jL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ENubHA6NL._AC_UY218_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ENubHA6NL._AC_UY654_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '2x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81DBK93b6jL._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ENubHA6NL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51sby+AZ5KS._AC_UY218_.jpg'], '2.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81DBK93b6jL._AC_UY545_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ENubHA6NL._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '3x': [], '3.5x': [], '4x': []}","['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81DBK93b6jL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ENubHA6NL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61hFys0MnNL.jpg']",

How did the universe grow from a tiny fireball to its present size?
Where did life on earth come from?
How do planets form?
How will the universe end?
And how do we even know all this anyway?
John Gribbin, one of Britain's most popular writers about science and the people who made it happen, has decided to create a biography of the greatest subject of all: the universe itself, from beginning to end (and beyond).
From the Big Bang 14 billion years ago, the formation of stars and galaxies and the first stirrings of life, to the latest thinking on dark matter and a theory of everything - and beyond to the future possibility of a Big Crunch or a Big Rip - this is the life history of the entire world around us.
John Gribbin is one of today's greatest writers of popular science and the author of bestselling books, including In Search of Schrödinger's Cat, Stardust, Science: A History and In Search of the Multiverse. Gribbin trained as an astrophysicist at Cambridge University and is currently Visiting Fellow in Astronomy at the University of Sussex.","['Science', 'Science', 'Physics', 'Nonfiction', 'Science', 'Astronomy']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347562817l/2715644.jpg,"{'1x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51oHUvYzbsL._AC_UY218_.jpg'], '1.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51oHUvYzbsL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '2x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51oHUvYzbsL._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '2.5x': [], '3x': [], '3.5x': [], '4x': []}","['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51oHUvYzbsL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91LUwz1QAPL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31Oy754kevL.jpg']",

One of the world's foremost nuclear physicists (celebrated for his theory of radioactive decay, among other accomplishments), George Gamow possessed the unique ability of making the world of science accessible to the general reader.
He brings that ability to bear in this delightful expedition through the problems, pleasures, and puzzles of modern science. Among the topics scrutinized with the author's celebrated good humor and pedagogical prowess are the macrocosm and the microcosm, theory of numbers, relativity of space and time, entropy, genes, atomic structure, nuclear fission, and the origin of the solar system.
In the pages of this book readers grapple with such crucial matters as whether it is possible to bend space, why a rocket shrinks, the ""end of the world problem,"" excursions into the fourth dimension, and a host of other tantalizing topics for the scientifically curious. Brimming with amusing anecdotes and provocative problems, One Two Three . . . Infinity also includes over 120 delightful pen-and-ink illustrations by the author, adding another dimension of good-natured charm to these wide-ranging explorations.
Whatever your level of scientific expertise, chances are you'll derive a great deal of pleasure, stimulation, and information from this unusual and imaginative book. It belongs in the library of anyone curious about the wonders of the scientific universe. ""In One Two Three . . .

Today, physicists and mathematicians throughout the world are feverishly working on one of the most ambitious theories ever proposed: superstring theory. String theory, as it is often called, is the key to the Unified Field Theory that eluded Einstein for more than thirty years. Finally, the century-old antagonism between the large and the small--General Relativity and Quantum Theory--is resolved. String theory proclaims that all of the wondrous happenings in the universe, from the frantic dancing of subatomic quarks to the majestic swirling of heavenly galaxies, are reflections of one grand physical principle and manifestations of one single entity: microscopically tiny vibrating loops of energy, a billionth of a billionth the size of an atom. In this brilliantly articulated and refreshingly clear book, Greene relates the scientific story and the human struggle behind twentieth-century physics' search for a theory of everything.
Through the masterful use of metaphor and analogy, The Elegant Universe makes some of the most sophisticated concepts ever contemplated viscerally accessible and thoroughly entertaining, bringing us closer than ever to understanding how the universe works.","['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'Science', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Astronomy']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348791881l/8049273.jpg,"{'1x': [], '1.5x': [], '2x': [], '2.5x': [], '3x': [], '3.5x': [], '4x': []}",[],W.

One of the passengers is none other than detective Hercule Poirot. On vacation.
Isolated and with a killer on board, Poirot must identify the murderer—in case he or she decides to strike again.
Librarian's note: the first fifteen novels in the Hercule Poirot series are 1) The Mysterious Affair at Styles, 1920; 2) The Murder on the Links, 1923; 3) The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, 1926; 4) The Big Four, 1927; 5) The Mystery of the Blue Train, 1928; 6) Peril at End House, 1932; 7) Lord Edgware Dies, 1933; 8) Murder on the Orient Express, 1934; 9) Three Act Tragedy, 1935; 10) Death in the Clouds, 1935; 11) The A.B.C. Murders, 1936; 12) Murder in Mesopotamia, 1936; 13) Cards on the Table, 1936; 14) Dumb Witness, 1937; and 15) Death on the Nile, 1937. These are just the novels; Poirot also appears in this period in a play, Black Coffee, 1930, and two collections of short stories, Poirot Investigates, 1924, and Murder in the Mews, 1937. Each novel, play and short story has its own entry on Goodreads.","['Mystery', 'Classics', 'Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Crime', 'Thriller']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1486131451l/853510._SY475_.jpg,"{'1x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81YVXgvXoAL._AC_UY218_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81YVXgvXoAL._AC_UY654_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81u6pPXJ0xL._AC_UY545_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '1.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81YVXgvXoAL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81u6pPXJ0xL._AC_UY218_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81u6pPXJ0xL._AC_UY654_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '2x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81YVXgvXoAL._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81u6pPXJ0xL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81zMsOfk63L._AC_UY218_.jpg'], '2.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81YVXgvXoAL._AC_UY545_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81u6pPXJ0xL._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81zMsOfk63L._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '3x': [], '3.5x': [], '4x': []}","['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81YVXgvXoAL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81zMsOfk63L.jpg']",HarperCollins

Even worse, my best friend Bastille (she’s a girl, and a friend, but not really my girlfriend…I think?) was put in a coma by those Librarian slugs. So I owed them one for that.
And worse than worse, I needed to enter the heart of Librarian power—the dreaded Highbrary—if I was ever going to bring Bastille back to life and stop my know-it-all hotshot renegade father from unleashing chaos all over the world just because he thinks it’s the right thing to do.","['Fantasy', 'Young Adult', 'Fiction', 'Childrens', 'Middle Grade', 'Humor']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1443207060l/26114421.jpg,"{'1x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91Stcs0UrnS._AC_UY218_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91Stcs0UrnS._AC_UY654_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '1.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91Stcs0UrnS._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91hBh0nfCfL._AC_UY218_.jpg'], '2x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91Stcs0UrnS._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91hBh0nfCfL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '2.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91Stcs0UrnS._AC_UY545_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91hBh0nfCfL._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '3x': [], '3.5x': [], '4x': []}","['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91Stcs0UrnS.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41DnnQtDv8L.jpg']",Starscape

Now Rysn's pet is ill, and any hope for Chiri-Chiri’s recovery can be found only at the ancestral home of the larkin: Akinah. With the help of Lopen, the formerly one-armed Windrunner, Rysn must accept Navani's quest and sail into the perilous storm from which no one has returned alive. If the crew cannot uncover the secrets of the hidden island city before the wrath of its ancient guardians falls upon them, the fate of Roshar and the entire Cosmere hangs in the balance.","['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Novella', 'Fantasy', 'Epic Fantasy', 'Fantasy']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1603931041l/54511226._SX318_.jpg,"{'1x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81E+Yp2VyZL._AC_UY218_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81E+Yp2VyZL._AC_UY654_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '1.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81E+Yp2VyZL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41yVs-HswtL._AC_UY218_.jpg'], '2x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81E+Yp2VyZL._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41yVs-HswtL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '2.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81E+Yp2VyZL._AC_UY545_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41yVs-HswtL._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '3x': [], '3.5x': [], '4x': []}",['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41yVs-HswtL.jpg'],Dragonsteel Entertainment

However as Davian and his new allies hurry north toward the ever-weakening Boundary, fresh horrors along their path suggest that their reprieve may have come far too late.
In the capital, Wirr is forced to contend with assassins and an increasingly hostile Administration as he controversially assumes the mantle of Northwarden, uncovering a mystery that draws into question everything commonly believed about the rebellion his father led twenty years ago.

The dictatorial Augurs—once thought of almost as gods—were overthrown and wiped out during the conflict, their much-feared powers mysteriously failing them. Those who had ruled under them, men and women with a lesser ability known as the Gift, avoided the Augurs' fate only by submitting themselves to the rebellion's Four Tenets. A representation of these laws is now written into the flesh of any who use the Gift, forcing those so marked into absolute obedience.
As a student of the Gifted, Davian suffers the consequences of a war fought—and lost—before he was born. Despised by most beyond the school walls, he and those around him are all but prisoners as they attempt to learn control of the Gift. Worse, as Davian struggles with his lessons, he knows that there is further to fall if he cannot pass his final tests.
But when Davian discovers he has the ability to wield the forbidden power of the Augurs, he sets into motion a chain of events that will change everything. To the north, an ancient enemy long thought defeated begins to stir.

Golden Son changed the game and took the story of Darrow to the next level. Now comes the exhilarating conclusion to the Red Rising Trilogy: Morning Star.
Darrow would have lived in peace, but his enemies brought him war. The Gold overlords demanded his obedience, hanged his wife, and enslaved his people. But Darrow is determined to fight back. Risking everything to transform himself and breach Gold society, Darrow has battled to survive the cutthroat rivalries that breed Society’s mightiest warriors, climbed the ranks, and waited patiently to unleash the revolution that will tear the hierarchy apart from within.
Finally, the time has come.
But devotion to honor and hunger for vengeance run deep on both sides. Darrow and his comrades-in-arms face powerful enemies without scruple or mercy. Among them are some Darrow once considered friends. To win, Darrow will need to inspire those shackled in darkness to break their chains, unmake the world their cruel masters have built, and claim a destiny too long denied—and too glorious to surrender.","['Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Young Adult']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1461354277l/18966806.jpg,"{'1x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61sGD9axseL._AC_UY218_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61sGD9axseL._AC_UY654_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gcawQd+VS._AC_UY545_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '1.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61sGD9axseL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gcawQd+VS._AC_UY218_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gcawQd+VS._AC_UY654_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '2x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61sGD9axseL._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gcawQd+VS._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41oRZuRMnhL._AC_UY218_.jpg'], '2.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61sGD9axseL._AC_UY545_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gcawQd+VS._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '3x': [], '3.5x': [], '4x': []}","['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61sGD9axseL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71gcawQd+VS.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71JcTJTQ0cL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/513zcHazI-L.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81VrBKTnYeL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51DaEJb-zgL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/518fUzi3ICL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41KmACDdxOL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41FaOPU1jKL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41oRZuRMnhL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/418LhoyISfL.jpg']",Del Rey

But the Society he faithfully served was built on lies. Darrow’s kind have been betrayed and denied by their elitist masters, the Golds—and their only path to liberation is revolution. And so Darrow sacrifices himself in the name of the greater good for which Eo, his true love and inspiration, laid down her own life. He becomes a Gold, infiltrating their privileged realm so that he can destroy it from within.
A lamb among wolves in a cruel world, Darrow finds friendship, respect, and even love—but also the wrath of powerful rivals.

Darrow is a Red, a member of the lowest caste in the color-coded society of the future. Like his fellow Reds, he works all day, believing that he and his people are making the surface of Mars livable for future generations.
Yet he spends his life willingly, knowing that his blood and sweat will one day result in a better world for his children.
But Darrow and his kind have been betrayed. Soon he discovers that humanity already reached the surface generations ago. Vast cities and sprawling parks spread across the planet. Darrow—and Reds like him—are nothing more than slaves to a decadent ruling class.
Inspired by a longing for justice, and driven by the memory of lost love, Darrow sacrifices everything to infiltrate the legendary Institute, a proving ground for the dominant Gold caste, where the next generation of humanity's overlords struggle for power. He will be forced to compete for his life and the very future of civilization against the best and most brutal of Society's ruling class. There, he will stop at nothing to bring down his enemies... even if it means he has to become one of them to do so.","['Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Young Adult', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Dystopia']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1461354651l/15839976.jpg,"{'1x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71QVNhOZ46L._AC_UY218_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71QVNhOZ46L._AC_UY654_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71D4lBzokCL._AC_UY545_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '1.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71QVNhOZ46L._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71D4lBzokCL._AC_UY218_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71D4lBzokCL._AC_UY654_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '2x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71QVNhOZ46L._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71D4lBzokCL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gcawQd+VS._AC_UY218_.jpg'], '2.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71QVNhOZ46L._AC_UY545_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71D4lBzokCL._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gcawQd+VS._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '3x': [], '3.5x': [], '4x': []}","['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71QVNhOZ46L.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sYsdMeI8L.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/413T3bzTGwL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71D4lBzokCL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZbN0Gv0GL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71gcawQd+VS.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71JcTJTQ0cL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/513zcHazI-L.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81VrBKTnYeL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51DaEJb-zgL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/518fUzi3ICL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41KmACDdxOL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41FaOPU1jKL.jpg']",

Mare Barrow’s blood is red—the color of common folk—but her Silver ability, the power to control lightning, has turned her into a weapon that the royal court tries to control.
The crown calls her an impossibility, a fake, but as she makes her escape from Maven, the prince—the friend—who betrayed her, Mare uncovers something startling: she is not the only one of her kind.
Pursued by Maven, now a vindictive king, Mare sets out to find and recruit other Red-and-Silver fighters to join in the struggle against her oppressors.
But Mare finds herself on a deadly path, at risk of becoming exactly the kind of monster she is trying to defeat.
Will she shatter under the weight of the lives that are the cost of rebellion? Or have treachery and betrayal hardened her forever?

Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth returns again. In the Third Age, an Age of Prophecy, the World and Time themselves hang in the balance.

When Robert Jordan died in 2007, all feared that these concluding scenes would never be written. But working from notes and partials left by Jordan, established fantasy writer Brandon Sanderson stepped in to complete the masterwork. With The Gathering Storm (Book 12) and Towers of Midnight (Book 13) behind him, Sanderson now re-creates the vision that Robert Jordan left behind.
Edited by Jordan's widow, who edited all of Jordan's books, A Memory of Light will delight, enthrall, and deeply satisfy all of Jordan's legions of readers.

Or at least Jean has. But Locke is slowly succumbing to a deadly poison that no alchemist or physiker can cure. Yet just as the end is near, a mysterious Bondsmage offers Locke an opportunity that will either save him or finish him off once and for all.
Magi political elections are imminent, and the factions are in need of a pawn. If Locke agrees to play the role, sorcery will be used to purge the venom from his body - though the process will be so excruciating he may well wish for death. Locke is opposed, but two factors cause his will to crumble: Jean's imploring - and the Bondsmage's mention of a woman from Locke's past: Sabetha. She is the love of his life, his equal in skill and wit, and now, his greatest rival.
Locke was smitten with Sabetha from his first glimpse of her as a young fellow orphan and thief-in-training. But after a tumultuous courtship, Sabetha broke away. Now they will reunite in yet another clash of wills. For faced with his one and only match in both love and trickery, Locke must choose whether to fight Sabetha - or to woo her.

The Last Battle has started. The seals on the Dark One’s prison are crumbling. The Pattern itself is unraveling, and the armies of the Shadow have begun to boil out of the Blight.
The sun has begun to set upon the Third Age.
Perrin Aybara is now hunted by specters from his past: Whitecloaks, a slayer of wolves, and the responsibilities of leadership. All the while, an unseen foe is slowly pulling a noose tight around his neck. To prevail, he must seek answers in Tel’aran’rhiod and find a way--at long last--to master the wolf within him or lose himself to it forever
Meanwhile, Matrim Cauthon prepares for the most difficult challenge of his life. The creatures beyond the stone gateways--the Aelfinn and the Eelfinn--have confused him, taunted him, and left him hanged, his memory stuffed with bits and pieces of other men’s lives. He had hoped that his last confrontation with them would be the end of it, but the Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills. The time is coming when he will again have to dance with the Snakes and the Foxes, playing a game that cannot be won. The Tower of Ghenjei awaits, and its secrets will reveal the fate of a friend long lost.
This penultimate novel of Robert Jordan’s #1 New York Times bestselling series--the second of three based on materials he left behind when he died in 2007--brings dramatic and compelling developments to many threads in the Pattern. The end draws near.

Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth returns again. In the Third Age, an Age of Prophecy, the World and Time themselves hang in the balance. What was, what will be, and what is, may yet fall under the Shadow.
Tarmon Gai'don, the Last Battle, looms. And mankind is not ready.
The final volume of the Wheel of Time, A Memory of Light, was partially written by Robert Jordan before his untimely passing in 2007. Brandon Sanderson, New York Times bestselling author of the Mistborn books, and now Stormlight Archive, among others, was chosen by Jordan's editor--his wife, Harriet McDougal--to complete the final volume, later expanded to three books.
In this epic novel, Robert Jordan's international bestselling series begins its dramatic conclusion. Rand al'Thor, the Dragon Reborn, struggles to unite a fractured network of kingdoms and alliances in preparation for the Last Battle. As he attempts to halt the Seanchan encroachment northward--wishing he could form at least a temporary truce with the invaders--his allies watch in terror the shadow that seems to be growing within the heart of the Dragon Reborn himself.
Egwene al'Vere, the Amyrlin Seat of the rebel Aes Sedai, is a captive of the White Tower and subject to the whims of their tyrannical leader. As days tick toward the Seanchan attack she knows is imminent, Egwene works to hold together the disparate factions of Aes Sedai while providing leadership in the face of increasing uncertainty and despair.

But Rand dares not fight until he possesses all the surviving seals on the Dark One's prison and has dealt with the Seanchan, who threaten to overrun all nations this side of the Aryth Ocean and increasingly seem too entrenched to be fought off. But his attempt to make a truce with the Seanchan is shadowed by treachery that may cost him everything. Whatever the price, though, he must have that truce. And he faces other dangers.
The winds of time have become a storm, and things that everyone believes are fixed in place forever are changing before their eyes. Even the White Tower itself is no longer a place of safety. Now Rand, Perrin and Mat, Egwene and Elayne, Nynaeve and Lan, and even Loial, must ride those storm winds, or the Dark One will triumph.","['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Epic Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'High Fantasy']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1397856387l/13888.jpg,"{'1x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81h4yOI+wZL._AC_UY218_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81h4yOI+wZL._AC_UY654_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71iKu9NSVUL._AC_UY545_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '1.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81h4yOI+wZL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71iKu9NSVUL._AC_UY218_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71iKu9NSVUL._AC_UY654_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '2x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81h4yOI+wZL._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71iKu9NSVUL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61k7Rb+AT0L._AC_UY218_.jpg'], '2.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81h4yOI+wZL._AC_UY545_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71iKu9NSVUL._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61k7Rb+AT0L._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '3x': [], '3.5x': [], '4x': []}","['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71iKu9NSVUL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-F3UiPSGL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qANiZxjqL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zHevgmfwL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PXg6XwlQL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41np52pVheL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61k7Rb+AT0L.jpg']",Tom Doherty Associates

Fleeing from Ebou Dar with the kidnapped Daughter of the Nine Moons, whom he is fated to marry, Mat Cauthon learns that he can neither keep her nor let her go, not in safety for either of them, for both the Shadow and the might of the Seanchan Empire are in deadly pursuit.
Perrin Aybara seeks to free his wife, Faile, a captive of the Shaido, but his only hope may be an alliance with the enemy. Can he remain true to his friend Rand and to himself? For his love of Faile, Perrin is willing to sell his soul.
At Tar Valon, Egwene al'Vere, the young Amyrlin of the rebel Aes Sedai, lays siege to the heart of Aes Sedai power, but she must win quickly, with as little bloodshed as possible, for unless the Aes Sedai are reunited, only the male Asha'man will remain to defend the world against the Dark One, and nothing can hold the Asha'man themselves back from total power except the Aes Sedai and a unified White Tower.
In Andor, Elayne Trakland fights for the Lion Throne that is hers by right, but enemies and Darkfriends surround her, plotting her destruction. If she fails, Andor may fall to the Shadow, and the Dragon Reborn with it.
Rand al'Thor, the Dragon Reborn himself, has cleansed the Dark One's taint from the male half of the True Source, and everything has changed. Yet nothing has, for only men who can channel believe that saidin is clean again, and a man who can channel is still hated and feared-even one prophesied to save the world. Now, Rand must gamble again, with himself at stake, and he cannot be sure which of his allies are really enemies.

Faile, with the Aiel Maidens, Bain and Chiad, and her companions, Queen Alliandre and Morgase, is prisoner of Savanna's sept.
Perrin is desperately searching for Faile. With Elyas Machera, Berelain, the Prophet and a very mixed ""army"" of disparate forces, he is moving through country rife with bandits and roving Seanchan.

The city of Canluum lies close to the scarred and desolate wastes of the Blight, a walled haven from the dangers away to the north, and a refuge from the ill works of those who serve the Dark One. Or so it is said. The city that greets Al'Lan Mandragoran, exiled king of Malkier and the finest swordsman of his generation, is instead one that is rife with rumour and the whisperings of Shadowspawn. Proof, should he have required it, that the Dark One grows powerful once more and that his minions are at work throughout the lands.
And yet it is within Canluum's walls that Lan will meet a woman who will shape his destiny. Moiraine is a young and powerful Aes Sedai who has journeyed to the city in search of a bondsman. She requires aid in a desperate quest to prove the truth of a vague and largely discredited prophecy - one that speaks of a means to turn back the shadow, and of a child who may be the dragon reborn.","['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Epic Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'High Fantasy']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328959234l/187065.jpg,"{'1x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81sTyeBdJjL._AC_UY218_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81sTyeBdJjL._AC_UY654_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51oZi4ctbzL._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '1.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81sTyeBdJjL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51oZi4ctbzL._AC_UY218_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51oZi4ctbzL._AC_UY500_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '2x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81sTyeBdJjL._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51oZi4ctbzL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51qjx-bDS4L._AC_UY218_.jpg'], '2.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81sTyeBdJjL._AC_UY545_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '3x': [], '3.5x': [], '4x': []}",[],Orbit

The corpse is that of a pioneer in the field of experimental biotechnology, a man whose work concerned the use of the human body as a massive storage device. He may have embedded something in the cells of his now dead body. And that something might be dangerous…
What follows is a visionary thriller about the potential uses of technology, the mysteries of the human personality, and the ancient human need to believe that death is not the end.

His ambitious, multi-volume epics (Mistborn, The Stormlight Archive) and Hugo Award-winning The Emperor's Soul have earned both critical acclaim and a substantial popular following.
In the Legion series, distinctly contemporary novellas filled with suspense, humor, and an endless flow of invention, Sanderson has revealed a startling new facet of his singular narrative talent. Stephen Leeds, AKA “Legion,” is the series' hero, a man whose unique mental condition allows him to generate a multitude of personae: hallucinatory entities with a wide variety of personal characteristics and a vast array of highly specialized skills.
The third and final entry in the series, Lies of the Beholder, is perhaps the strangest, most unpredictable installment to date.
The story begins with two seemingly unrelated events: the disappearance of Armando, one of Stephen's many “aspects,” and an unexpected cry for help from Sandra, the woman who, many years before, helped him learn to live with his condition. These events lead Stephen, along with several of his aspects, to a sinister high-tech firm specializing in advanced methods of human incarceration.
The result is a visionary meditation on the mysteries of the human personality. Like the volumes that preceded it, Sanderson's latest is original, challenging, and utterly absorbing. In Stephen Leeds, a man constantly struggling to understand and control his own divided nature, he has created one of the most compelling heroes in recent popular fiction. Like the best of Sanderson's work, Lies of the Beholder is something special. It is the clear product of a master storyteller, and it is not to be missed","['Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Novella']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1522700684l/37640636.jpg,"{'1x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51vOf4OyRyL._AC_UY218_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51vOf4OyRyL._AC_UY500_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '1.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51vOf4OyRyL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/610B6xsSpTL._AC_UY218_.jpg'], '2x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51vOf4OyRyL._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/610B6xsSpTL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '2.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/610B6xsSpTL._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '3x': [], '3.5x': [], '4x': []}","['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51vOf4OyRyL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/610B6xsSpTL.jpg']",Subterranean Press

Once the Reckoners’ leader, Prof has now embraced his Epic destiny. He’s disappeared into those murky shadows of menace Epics are infamous for the world over, and everyone knows there’s no turning back. . . .

For years, frontier lawman turned big-city senator Waxillium Ladrian has hunted the shadowy organization the Set—with his late uncle and his sister among their leaders—since they started kidnapping people with the power of Allomancy in their bloodlines. When Detective Marasi Colms and her partner Wayne find stockpiled weapons bound for the Outer City of Bilming, this opens a new lead. Conflict between Elendel and the Outer Cities only favors the Set, and their tendrils now reach to the Elendel Senate—whose corruption Wax and Steris have sought to expose—and Bilming is even more entangled.
After Wax discovers a new type of explosive that can unleash unprecedented destruction and realizes that the Set must already have it, an immortal kandra serving Scadrial’s god reveals that Harmony’s power is blocked in Bilming. That means the city has fallen under the influence of another god: Trell, worshipped by the Set. And Trell isn’t the only factor at play from the larger Cosmere—Marasi is recruited by offworlders with strange abilities who claim their goal is to protect Scadrial…at any cost.
Harmony’s vision of future possibilities comes to an abrupt halt tomorrow night, with only blackness after that. It’s a race against time, and Wax must choose whether to set aside his rocky relationship with God and once again become the Sword that Harmony has groomed him to be. If no one steps forward to be the hero Scadrial needs, the planet and its millions of people will come to a sudden and calamitous ruin.","['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'High Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Epic Fantasy']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1653582537l/23947089.jpg,"{'1x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/719muYCQjOL._AC_UY218_.jpg'], '1.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/719muYCQjOL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '2x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/719muYCQjOL._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '2.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/719muYCQjOL._AC_UY545_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '3x': [], '3.5x': [], '4x': []}",[],Tor Books

When Shai is caught replacing the Moon Scepter with her nearly flawless forgery, she must bargain for her life. An assassin has left the Emperor Ashravan without consciousness, a circumstance concealed only by the death of his wife. If the emperor does not emerge after his hundred-day mourning period, the rule of the Heritage Faction will be forfeit and the empire will fall into chaos.

She is confined to a tiny, dirty chamber, guarded by a man who hates her, spied upon by politicians, and trapped behind a door sealed in her own blood.

But Circe is a strange child - not powerful, like her father, nor viciously alluring like her mother. Turning to the world of mortals for companionship, she discovers that she does possess power - the power of witchcraft, which can transform rivals into monsters and menace the gods themselves.
Threatened, Zeus banishes her to a deserted island, where she hones her occult craft, tames wild beasts and crosses paths with many of the most famous figures in all of mythology, including the Minotaur, Daedalus and his doomed son Icarus, the murderous Medea, and, of course, wily Odysseus.
But there is danger, too, for a woman who stands alone, and Circe unwittingly draws the wrath of both men and gods, ultimately finding herself pitted against one of the most terrifying and vengeful of the Olympians. To protect what she loves most, Circe must summon all her strength and choose, once and for all, whether she belongs with the gods she is born from, or the mortals she has come to love.","['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Mythology', 'Historical', 'Historical Fiction']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1565909496l/35959740._SY475_.jpg,"{'1x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ECswWT90L._AC_UY218_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ECswWT90L._AC_UY500_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71cJ5UYa+pL._AC_UY545_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '1.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ECswWT90L._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71cJ5UYa+pL._AC_UY218_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71cJ5UYa+pL._AC_UY654_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '2x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ECswWT90L._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71cJ5UYa+pL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61rnl04sgJL._AC_UY218_.jpg'], '2.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71cJ5UYa+pL._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61rnl04sgJL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '3x': [], '3.5x': [], '4x': []}","['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ECswWT90L.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71cJ5UYa+pL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61rnl04sgJL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ECswWT90L.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81BQtiL6i9L.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Xy0swIo4L.jpg']","Little, Brown and Company"

After forming a coalition of human resistance against the enemy invasion, Dalinar Kholin and his Knights Radiant have spent a year fighting a protracted, brutal war. Neither side has gained an advantage, and the threat of a betrayal by Dalinar's crafty ally Taravangian looms over every strategic move.
Now, as new technological discoveries by Navani Kholin's scholars begin to change the face of the war, the enemy prepares a bold and dangerous operation. The arms race that follows will challenge the very core of the Radiant ideals, and potentially reveal the secrets of the ancient tower that was once the heart of their strength.
At the same time that Kaladin Stormblessed must come to grips with his changing role within the Knights Radiant, his Windrunners face their own problem: As more and more deadly enemy Fused awaken to wage war, no more honorspren are willing to bond with humans to increase the number of Radiants. Adolin and Shallan must lead the coalition’s envoy to the honorspren stronghold of Lasting Integrity and either convince the spren to join the cause against the evil god Odium, or personally face the storm of failure.","['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Epic Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'High Fantasy']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1599911216l/49021976.jpg,"{'1x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/510D2xf2MbS._AC_UY218_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/510D2xf2MbS._AC_UY500_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gV6m6xMRL._AC_UY545_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '1.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/510D2xf2MbS._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gV6m6xMRL._AC_UY218_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gV6m6xMRL._AC_UY654_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '2x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/510D2xf2MbS._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gV6m6xMRL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71FrxDZ7m+L._AC_UY218_.jpg'], '2.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gV6m6xMRL._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71FrxDZ7m+L._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '3x': [], '3.5x': [], '4x': []}","['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/510D2xf2MbS.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71gV6m6xMRL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FrxDZ7m+L.jpg']",Tor Books

Dalinar Kholin's Alethi armies won a fleeting victory at a terrible cost: The enemy Parshendi summoned the violent Everstorm, which now sweeps the world with destruction, and in its passing awakens the once peaceful and subservient parshmen to the horror of their millennia-long enslavement by humans. While on a desperate flight to warn his family of the threat, Kaladin Stormblessed must come to grips with the fact that the newly kindled anger of the parshmen may be wholly justified.
Nestled in the mountains high above the storms, in the tower city of Urithiru, Shallan Davar investigates the wonders of the ancient stronghold of the Knights Radiant and unearths dark secrets lurking in its depths. And Dalinar realizes that his holy mission to unite his homeland of Alethkar was too narrow in scope. Unless all the nations of Roshar can put aside Dalinar's blood-soaked past and stand together--and unless Dalinar himself can confront that past--even the restoration of the Knights Radiant will not prevent the end of civilization.","['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Epic Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'High Fantasy']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1654573897l/34002132._SY475_.jpg,"{'1x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81pwvsQG5cL._AC_UY218_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81pwvsQG5cL._AC_UY654_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ZKFyf9XHL._AC_UY545_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '1.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81pwvsQG5cL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ZKFyf9XHL._AC_UY218_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ZKFyf9XHL._AC_UY654_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '2x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81pwvsQG5cL._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ZKFyf9XHL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81h+XjvtBeL._AC_UY218_.jpg'], '2.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81pwvsQG5cL._AC_UY545_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ZKFyf9XHL._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81h+XjvtBeL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '3x': [], '3.5x': [], '4x': []}","['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81pwvsQG5cL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81AwdmWyYnL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81f+5A8HwVL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81yXjBCkjsL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ZKFyf9XHL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81h+XjvtBeL.jpg']",Tor Books

Expected by his enemies to die the miserable death of a military slave, Kaladin survived to be given command of the royal bodyguards, a controversial first for a low-status ""darkeyes."" Now he must protect the king and Dalinar from every common peril as well as the distinctly uncommon threat of the Assassin, all while secretly struggling to master remarkable new powers that are somehow linked to his honorspren, Syl.
The Assassin, Szeth, is active again, murdering rulers all over the world of Roshar, using his baffling powers to thwart every bodyguard and elude all pursuers. Among his prime targets is Highprince Dalinar, widely considered the power behind the Alethi throne. His leading role in the war would seem reason enough, but the Assassin's master has much deeper motives.
Brilliant but troubled Shallan strives along a parallel path. Despite being broken in ways she refuses to acknowledge, she bears a terrible burden: to somehow prevent the return of the legendary Voidbringers and the civilization-ending Desolation that will follow. The secrets she needs can be found at the Shattered Plains, but just arriving there proves more difficult than she could have imagined.
Meanwhile, at the heart of the Shattered Plains, the Parshendi are making an epochal decision. Hard pressed by years of Alethi attacks, their numbers ever shrinking, they are convinced by their war leader, Eshonai, to risk everything on a desperate gamble with the very supernatural forces they once fled. The possible consequences for Parshendi and humans alike, indeed, for Roshar itself, are as dangerous as they are incalculable.","['Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Epic Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'High Fantasy']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1507307927l/17332218.jpg,"{'1x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81o27Vl468L._AC_UY218_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81o27Vl468L._AC_UY654_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81x+KMPIwmL._AC_UY545_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '1.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81o27Vl468L._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81x+KMPIwmL._AC_UY218_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81x+KMPIwmL._AC_UY654_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '2x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81o27Vl468L._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81x+KMPIwmL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81qt237Up0L._AC_UY218_.jpg'], '2.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81o27Vl468L._AC_UY545_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81x+KMPIwmL._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81qt237Up0L._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '3x': [], '3.5x': [], '4x': []}","['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81o27Vl468L.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81lVE8KuIML.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41BIbC9nz9L.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81x+KMPIwmL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81qt237Up0L.jpg']",Tor Books

They will have a satyr companion, and Meg knows just who to call upon. . . .","['Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Mythology', 'Young Adult', 'Childrens', 'Middle Grade']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1516363168l/28006096.jpg,"{'1x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91X1ut15P4L._AC_UY218_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91X1ut15P4L._AC_UY654_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51PM0feDHNL._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '1.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91X1ut15P4L._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51PM0feDHNL._AC_UY218_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51PM0feDHNL._AC_UY500_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '2x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91X1ut15P4L._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51PM0feDHNL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Wk3FXt6CL._AC_UY218_.jpg'], '2.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91X1ut15P4L._AC_UY545_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Wk3FXt6CL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '3x': [], '3.5x': [], '4x': []}","['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91X1ut15P4L.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51PM0feDHNL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91G1bVdLmLL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81h2L0xr6XL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/910NfqAPmRL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81fgtCbieiL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91o4UBRuNTL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81nxJQkCv3S.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ft7xF4UwS.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Wk3FXt6CL.jpg']",Disney-Hyperion

After angering his father Zeus, the god Apollo is cast down from Olympus. Weak and disorientated, he lands in New York City as a regular teenage boy. Now, without his godly powers, the four-thousand-year-old deity must learn to survive in the modern world until he can somehow find a way to regain Zeus's favour.
But Apollo has many enemies—gods, monsters and mortals who would love to see the former Olympian permanently destroyed.

Yet each of these demigods was once an ordinary person until touched by the mysterious transforming power of the Shaod. Ten years ago, without warning, the magic failed. Elantrians became wizened, leper-like, powerless creatures, and Elantris itself dark, filthy, and crumbling.
Arelon's new capital, Kae, crouches in the shadow of Elantris. Princess Sarene of Teod arrives for a marriage of state with Crown Prince Raoden, hoping—based on their correspondence—to also find love. She finds instead that Raoden has died and she is considered his widow. Both Teod and Arelon are under threat as the last remaining holdouts against the imperial ambitions of the ruthless religious fanatics of Fjordell. So Sarene decides to use her new status to counter the machinations of Hrathen, a Fjordell high priest who has come to Kae to convert Arelon and claim it for his emperor and his god.
But neither Sarene nor Hrathen suspect the truth about Prince Raoden. Stricken by the same curse that ruined Elantris, Raoden was secretly exiled by his father to the dark city. His struggle to help the wretches trapped there begins a series of events that will bring hope to Arelon, and perhaps reveal the secret of Elantris itself.
A rare epic fantasy that doesn't recycle the classics and that is a complete and satisfying story in one volume, Elantris is fleet and fun, full of surprises and characters to care about.

In Norse Mythology, Gaiman stays true to the myths in envisioning the major Norse pantheon: Odin, the highest of the high, wise, daring, and cunning; Thor, Odin’s son, incredibly strong yet not the wisest of gods; and Loki—son of a giant—blood brother to Odin and a trickster and unsurpassable manipulator.
Gaiman fashions these primeval stories into a novelistic arc that begins with the genesis of the legendary nine worlds and delves into the exploits of deities, dwarfs, and giants. Through Gaiman’s deft and witty prose, these gods emerge with their fiercely competitive natures, their susceptibility to being duped and to duping others, and their tendency to let passion ignite their actions, making these long-ago myths breathe pungent life again.","['Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Mythology', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Short Stories']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1516128292l/37903770._SX318_.jpg,"{'1x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91bBWBGI5+L._AC_UY218_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91bBWBGI5+L._AC_UY654_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91eQdDQvwUL._AC_UY545_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '1.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91bBWBGI5+L._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91eQdDQvwUL._AC_UY218_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91eQdDQvwUL._AC_UY654_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '2x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91bBWBGI5+L._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91eQdDQvwUL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91CJ5n2FucL._AC_UY218_.jpg'], '2.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91bBWBGI5+L._AC_UY545_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91eQdDQvwUL._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91CJ5n2FucL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '3x': [], '3.5x': [], '4x': []}","['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91bBWBGI5+L.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91eQdDQvwUL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51pt6+Q--cS.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/916JgRigQHL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81d4GyvmDYL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81RA389dlDL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81czZaXwGLL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71BD0PwddUL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91N-UOuVAkL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81doMV53vsL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91DUBTDlgrL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/6155wAeMe3L.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91CJ5n2FucL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61+bFabUYDL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/813rXMaeXbL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91PyFttVOWL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91JC1M+85ZL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91gHW6O1gyL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/910GCd1aNLL.jpg']",W.

Filled with unforgettable characters, mind-bending speculation, and nonstop action, I, Robot is a powerful reading experience from one of the master storytellers of our time.
I, ROBOT
They mustn't harm a human being, they must obey hitman orders, and they must protect their own existence...but only so long as that doesn't violate rules one and two. With these Three Laws of Robotics, humanity embarked on perhaps its greatest adventure: the invention of the first positronic man. It was a bold new era of evolution that would open up enormous possibilities—and unforeseen risks. For the scientists who invented the earliest robots weren't content that their creations should ' remain programmed helpers, companions, and semisentient worker-machines. And soon the robots themselves; aware of their own intelligence, power, and humanity, aren't either.
As humans and robots struggle to survive together—and sometimes against each other—on earth and in space, the future of both hangs in the balance. Human men and women confront robots gone mad, telepathic robots, robot politicians, and vast robotic intelligences that may already secretly control the world. And both are asking the same questions: What is human? And is humanity obsolete?
In l, Robot Isaac Asimov changes forever our perception of robots, and human beings and updates the timeless myth of man's dream to play god. with all its rewards—and terrors.

So begins the Time Traveller’s astonishing firsthand account of his journey 800,000 years beyond his own era—and the story that launched H.G. Wells’s successful career and earned him his reputation as the father of science fiction. With a speculative leap that still fires the imagination, Wells sends his brave explorer to face a future burdened with our greatest hopes...and our darkest fears. A pull of the Time Machine’s lever propels him to the age of a slowly dying Earth.  There he discovers two bizarre races—the ethereal Eloi and the subterranean Morlocks—who not only symbolize the duality of human nature, but offer a terrifying portrait of the men of tomorrow as well.

The Silmarillion,J.R.R. Tolkien,9780618391110.0,0618391118,386,3.96,247823,1977-09-15,,,The Silmarillion,Standalone,1,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/259055,"A number-one New York Times bestseller when it was originally published, The Silmarillion is the core of J.R.R. Tolkien's imaginative writing, a work whose origins stretch back to a time long before The Hobbit.
Tolkien considered The Silmarillion his most important work, and, though it was published last and posthumously, this great collection of tales and legends clearly sets the stage for all his other writing. The story of the creation of the world and of the First Age, this is the ancient drama to which the characters in The Lord of the Rings look back and in whose events some of them, such as Elrond and Galadriel, took part. The three Silmarils were jewels created by Feanor, most gifted of the Elves. Within them was imprisoned the Light of the Two Trees of Valinor before the Trees themselves were destroyed by Morgoth, the first Dark Lord. Thereafter, the unsullied Light of Valinor live on only in the Silmarils, but they were seized by Morgoth and set in his crown, which was guarded in the impenetrable fortress of Angband in the north of Middle-earth. The Silmarillion is the history of the rebellion of Feanor and his kindred against the gods, their exile from Valinor and return to Middle-earth, and their war, hopeless despite all their heroism, against the great Enemy.
This second edition features a letter written by J.R.R. Tolkein describing his intentions for the book, which serves as a brilliant exposition of his conception of the earlier Ages of Middle-earth.","['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Fantasy', 'High Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1276526473l/259055.jpg,"{'1x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/618ZBgv7riL._AC_UY218_.jpg'], '1.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/618ZBgv7riL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '2x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/618ZBgv7riL._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '2.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/618ZBgv7riL._AC_UY545_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '3x': [], '3.5x': [], '4x': []}",['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/618ZBgv7riL.jpg'],

In the aftermath of a colossal battle, the future of the Seven Kingdoms hangs in the balance—beset by newly emerging threats from every direction. In the east, Daenerys Targaryen, the last scion of House Targaryen, rules with her three dragons as queen of a city built on dust and death. But Daenerys has thousands of enemies, and many have set out to find her. As they gather, one young man embarks upon his own quest for the queen, with an entirely different goal in mind.
Fleeing from Westeros with a price on his head, Tyrion Lannister, too, is making his way to Daenerys. But his newest allies in this quest are not the rag-tag band they seem, and at their heart lies one who could undo Daenerys’s claim to Westeros forever.
Meanwhile, to the north lies the mammoth Wall of ice and stone—a structure only as strong as those guarding it. There, Jon Snow, 998th Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch, will face his greatest challenge. For he has powerful foes not only within the Watch but also beyond, in the land of the creatures of ice.
From all corners, bitter conflicts reignite, intimate betrayals are perpetrated, and a grand cast of outlaws and priests, soldiers and skinchangers, nobles and slaves, will face seemingly insurmountable obstacles. Some will fail, others will grow in the strength of darkness.

From the throne of glass rules a king with a fist of iron and a soul as black as pitch. Assassin Celaena Sardothien won a brutal contest to become his Champion. Yet Celaena is far from loyal to the crown. She hides her secret vigilantly; she knows that the man she serves is bent on evil.
Keeping up the deadly charade becomes increasingly difficult when Celaena realizes she is not the only one seeking justice. As she tries to untangle the mysteries buried deep within the glass castle, her closest relationships suffer. It seems no one is above questioning her allegiances—not the Crown Prince Dorian; not Chaol, the Captain of the Guard; not even her best friend, Nehemia, a foreign princess with a rebel heart.
Then one terrible night, the secrets they have all been keeping lead to an unspeakable tragedy. As Celaena's world shatters, she will be forced to give up the very thing most precious to her and decide once and for all where her true loyalties lie... and whom she is ultimately willing to fight for.","['Fantasy', 'Young Adult', 'Romance', 'Fantasy', 'Magic', 'Fiction']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1391580481l/17167166.jpg,"{'1x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ET-I0zZgL._AC_UY218_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ET-I0zZgL._AC_UY654_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91xdoPnx9qL._AC_UY545_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '1.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ET-I0zZgL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91xdoPnx9qL._AC_UY218_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91xdoPnx9qL._AC_UY654_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '2x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ET-I0zZgL._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91xdoPnx9qL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91IbxdJJReL._AC_UY218_.jpg'], '2.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ET-I0zZgL._AC_UY545_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91xdoPnx9qL._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91IbxdJJReL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '3x': [], '3.5x': [], '4x': []}","['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91xdoPnx9qL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91SJcibc3lL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91IbxdJJReL.jpg']",

When her competitors start dying one by one, Celaena’s fight for freedom becomes a fight for survival, and a desperate quest to root out the evil before it destroys her world.","['Fantasy', 'Young Adult', 'Romance', 'Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Young Adult Fantasy']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1495278054l/7896527.jpg,"{'1x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51BFbLtOcJL._AC_UY218_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51BFbLtOcJL._AC_UY500_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51-8HVqmWnL._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '1.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51BFbLtOcJL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51-8HVqmWnL._AC_UY218_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51-8HVqmWnL._AC_UY500_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '2x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51BFbLtOcJL._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51-8HVqmWnL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81UcTNneNCL._AC_UY218_.jpg'], '2.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81UcTNneNCL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '3x': [], '3.5x': [], '4x': []}","['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51BFbLtOcJL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51-8HVqmWnL.jpg']",Bloomsbury USA Children's

Her name is Auri, and she is full of mysteries.
The Slow Regard of Silent Things is a brief, bittersweet glimpse of Auri’s life, a small adventure all her own. At once joyous and haunting, this story offers a chance to see the world through Auri’s eyes. And it gives the reader a chance to learn things that only Auri knows...
In this book, Patrick Rothfuss brings us into the world of one of The Kingkiller Chronicle’s most enigmatic characters. Full of secrets and mysteries, The Slow Regard of Silent Things is the story of a broken girl trying to live in a broken world.

AUTHOR’S FOREWORD
You might not want to buy this book.
I know, that’s not the sort of thing an author is supposed to say. The marketing people aren’t going to like this. My editor is going to have a fit. But I’d rather be honest with you right out of the gate.
First, if you haven’t read my other books, you don’t want to start here.
My first two books are The Name of the Wind and The Wise Man’s Fear. If you’re curious to try my writing, start there. They’re the best introduction to my world. This book deals with Auri, one of the characters from that series. Without the context of those books, you’re probably going to feel pretty lost.
Second, even if you have read my other books, I think it’s only fair to warn you that this is a bit of a strange story. I don’t go in for spoilers, but suffice to say that this one is ... different. It doesn’t do a lot of the things a classic story is supposed to do. And if you’re looking for a continuation of Kvothe’s storyline, you’re not going to find it here.
On the other hand, if you’d like to learn more about Auri, this story has a lot to offer. If you love words and mysteries and secrets. If you’re curious about the Underthing and alchemy. If you want to know more about the hidden turnings of my world...
Well, then this book might be for you.

The Lord Ruler—the man who claimed to be god incarnate and brutally ruled the world for a thousand years—has been vanquished. But Kelsier, the hero who masterminded that triumph, is dead too, and now the awesome task of building a new world has been left to his young protégé, Vin, the former street urchin who is now the most powerful Mistborn in the land, and to the idealistic young nobleman she loves.
As Kelsier's protégé and slayer of the Lord Ruler she is now venerated by a budding new religion, a distinction that makes her intensely uncomfortable. Even more worrying, the mists have begun behaving strangely since the Lord Ruler died, and seem to harbor a strange vaporous entity that haunts her.
Stopping assassins may keep Vin's Mistborn skills sharp, but it's the least of her problems. Luthadel, the largest city of the former empire, doesn't run itself, and Vin and the other members of Kelsier's crew, who lead the revolution, must learn a whole new set of practical and political skills to help. It certainly won't get easier with three armies - one of them composed of ferocious giants - now vying to conquer the city, and no sign of the Lord Ruler's hidden cache of atium, the rarest and most powerful allomantic metal.

Mistborn
For a thousand years the ash fell and no flowers bloomed. For a thousand years the Skaa slaved in misery and lived in fear. For a thousand years the Lord Ruler, the ""Sliver of Infinity,"" reigned with absolute power and ultimate terror, divinely invincible. Then, when hope was so long lost that not even its memory remained, a terribly scarred, heart-broken half-Skaa rediscovered it in the depths of the Lord Ruler's most hellish prison. Kelsier ""snapped"" and found in himself the powers of a Mistborn. A brilliant thief and natural leader, he turned his talents to the ultimate caper, with the Lord Ruler himself as the mark.
Kelsier recruited the underworld's elite, the smartest and most trustworthy allomancers, each of whom shares one of his many powers, and all of whom relish a high-stakes challenge. Then Kelsier reveals his ultimate dream, not just the greatest heist in history, but the downfall of the divine despot.
But even with the best criminal crew ever assembled, Kel's plan looks more like the ultimate long shot, until luck brings a ragged girl named Vin into his life. Like him, she's a half-Skaa orphan, but she's lived a much harsher life. Vin has learned to expect betrayal from everyone she meets. She will have to learn trust if Kel is to help her master powers of which she never dreamed.
Brandon Sanderson, fantasy's newest master tale-spinner and author of the acclaimed debut Elantris, dares to turn a genre on its head by asking a simple question: What if the prophesied hero failed to defeat the Dark Lord?

My name is Kvothe.
I have stolen princesses back from sleeping barrow kings. I burned down the town of Trebon. I have spent the night with Felurian and left with both my sanity and my life. I was expelled from the University at a younger age than most people are allowed in. I tread paths by moonlight that others fear to speak of during day. I have talked to Gods, loved women, and written songs that make the minstrels weep.
You may have heard of me.
So begins the tale of a hero told from his own point of view — a story unequaled in fantasy literature. Now in The Wise Man's Fear, an escalating rivalry with a powerful member of the nobility forces Kvothe to leave the University and seek his fortune abroad. Adrift, penniless, and alone, he travels to Vintas, where he quickly becomes entangled in the politics of courtly society. While attempting to curry favor with a powerful noble, Kvothe uncovers an assassination attempt, comes into conflict with a rival arcanist, and leads a group of mercenaries into the wild, in an attempt to solve the mystery of who (or what) is waylaying travelers on the King's Road.
All the while, Kvothe searches for answers, attempting to uncover the truth about the mysterious Amyr, the Chandrian, and the death of his parents. Along the way, Kvothe is put on trial by the legendary Adem mercenaries, is forced to reclaim the honor of the Edema Ruh, and travels into the Fae realm. There he meets Felurian, the faerie woman no man can resist, and who no man has ever survived ... until Kvothe.
In The Wise Man's Fear, Kvothe takes his first steps on the path of the hero and learns how difficult life can be when a man becomes a legend in his own time.

As Annabeth and her friends Jason, Piper, and Leo fly in on the Argo II, she can't blame the Roman demigods for thinking the ship is a Greek weapon. With its steaming bronze dragon figurehead, Leo's fantastical creation doesn't appear friendly. Annabeth hopes that the sight of their praetor Jason on deck will reassure the Romans that the visitors from Camp Half-Blood are coming in peace.
And that's only one of her worries. In her pocket, Annabeth carries a gift from her mother that came with an unnerving command: Follow the Mark of Athena. Avenge me. Annabeth already feels weighed down by the prophecy that will send seven demigods on a quest to find—and close—the Doors of Death. What more does Athena want from her?
Annabeth's biggest fear, though, is that Percy might have changed. What if he's now attached to Roman ways? Does he still need his old friends? As the daughter of the goddess of war and wisdom, Annabeth knows she was born to be a leader—but never again does she want to be without Seaweed Brain by her side

His days have settled into a new kind of normal.
But Magnus should have known there's no such thing as normal in the Nine Worlds. His friends Hearthstone and Blitzen have disappeared. A new hallmate is creating chaos. According to a very nervous goat, a certain object belonging to Thor is still missing, and the thunder god's enemies will stop at nothing to gain control of it.

'The more I know of the world, the more am I convinced that I shall never see a man whom I can really love. I require so much!'
Marianne Dashwood wears her heart on her sleeve, and when she falls in love with the dashing but unsuitable John Willoughby she ignores her sister Elinor's warning that her impulsive behaviour leaves her open to gossip and innuendo. Meanwhile Elinor, always sensitive to social convention, is struggling to conceal her own romantic disappointment, even from those closest to her. Through their parallel experience of love—and its threatened loss—the sisters learn that sense must mix with sensibility if they are to find personal happiness in a society where status and money govern the rules of love.

Roshar is a world of stone and storms. Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.
It has been centuries since the fall of the ten consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them, and won by them.
One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where ten armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable.
Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity.
Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar's niece, Jasnah. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan's motives are less than pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.
The result of over ten years of planning, writing, and world-building, The Way of Kings is but the opening movement of the Stormlight Archive, a bold masterpiece in the making.
Speak again the ancient oaths:
Life before death.
Strength before weakness.
Journey before Destination.
and return to men the Shards they once bore.
The Knights Radiant must stand again.","['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Epic Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'High Fantasy']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388184640l/7235533.jpg,"{'1x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81jaZi+-0hL._AC_UY218_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81jaZi+-0hL._AC_UY654_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81BDOUL7VnL._AC_UY545_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '1.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81jaZi+-0hL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81BDOUL7VnL._AC_UY218_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81BDOUL7VnL._AC_UY654_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '2x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81jaZi+-0hL._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81BDOUL7VnL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51SykEm1q8L._AC_UY218_.jpg'], '2.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81jaZi+-0hL._AC_UY545_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81BDOUL7VnL._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51SykEm1q8L._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '3x': [], '3.5x': [], '4x': []}","['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81jaZi+-0hL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81BDOUL7VnL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81OFJj7PhlL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81DOAae5IvL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81SdPTjmV7L.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51SykEm1q8L.jpg']",Tor Books

Two great leaders—Lord Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon—who hold sway over an age of enforced peace are dead, victims of royal treachery. Now, from the ancient citadel of Dragonstone to the forbidding shores of Winterfell, chaos reigns. Six factions struggle for control of a divided land and the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms, preparing to stake their claims through tempest, turmoil, and war.
It is a tale in which brother plots against brother and the dead rise to walk in the night. Here a princess masquerades as an orphan boy; a knight of the mind prepares a poison for a treacherous sorceress; and wild men descend from the Mountains of the Moon to ravage the countryside. Against a backdrop of incest and fratricide, alchemy and murder, victory may go to the men and women possessed of the coldest steel...and the coldest hearts. For when kings clash, the whole land trembles.
Here is the second volume in George R.R. Martin magnificent cycle of novels that includes A Game of Thrones and A Storm of Swords.

It's not easy being Apollo, especially when you've been turned into a human and banished from Olympus. On his path to restoring five ancient oracles and reclaiming his godly powers, Apollo (aka Lester Papadopoulos) has faced both triumphs and tragedies. Now his journey takes him to Camp Jupiter in the San Francisco Bay Area, where the Roman demigods are preparing for a desperate last stand against the evil Triumvirate of Roman emperors. Hazel, Reyna, Frank, Tyson, Ella, and many other old friends will need Apollo's aid to survive the onslaught. Unfortunately, the answer to their salvation lies in the forgotten tomb of a Roman ruler . . . someone even worse than the emperors Apollo has already faced.","['Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Mythology', 'Young Adult', 'Childrens', 'Middle Grade']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1552008792l/28006109._SY475_.jpg,"{'1x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91VEG8fy0rL._AC_UY218_.jpg'], '1.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91VEG8fy0rL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '2x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91VEG8fy0rL._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '2.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91VEG8fy0rL._AC_UY545_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '3x': [], '3.5x': [], '4x': []}","['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91VEG8fy0rL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81gAAwslLlL.jpg']",Disney-Hyperion

Nominated as one of America’s best-loved novels by PBS’s The Great American Read.
Gulliver's Travels describes the four voyages of Lemuel Gulliver, a ship's surgeon. In Lilliput he discovers a world in miniature; towering over the people and their city, he is able to view their society from the viewpoint of a god. However, in Brobdingnag, a land of giants, tiny Gulliver himself comes under observation, exhibited as a curiosity at markets and fairs. In Laputa, a flying island, he encounters a society of speculators and projectors who have lost all grip on everyday reality; while they plan and calculate, their country lies in ruins. Gulliver's final voyage takes him to the land of the Houyhnhnms, gentle horses whom he quickly comes to admire - in contrast to the Yahoos, filthy bestial creatures who bear a disturbing resemblance to humans. This text, based on the first edition of 1726, reproduces all the original illustrations and includes an introduction by Robert Demaria, Jr, which discusses the ways Gulliver's Travels has been interpreted since its first publication. Jonathan Swift (1667-1745) was born in Dublin.

Decrepit castles, locked rooms, mysterious chests, cryptic notes, and tyrannical fathers give the story an uncanny air, but one with a decidedly satirical twist.
The story's unlikely heroine is Catherine Morland, a remarkably innocent seventeen-year-old woman from a country parsonage. While spending a few weeks in Bath with a family friend, Catherine meets and falls in love with Henry Tilney, who invites her to visit his family estate, Northanger Abbey. Once there, Catherine, a great reader of Gothic thrillers, lets the shadowy atmosphere of the old mansion fill her mind with terrible suspicions. What is the mystery surrounding the death of Henry's mother? Is the family concealing a terrible secret within the elegant rooms of the Abbey? Can she trust Henry, or is he part of an evil conspiracy? Catherine finds dreadful portents in the most prosaic events, until Henry persuades her to see the peril in confusing life with art.
Executed with high-spirited gusto, Northanger Abbey is a lighthearted, yet unsentimental commentary on love and marriage.","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Romance', 'Gothic', 'Historical', 'Historical Fiction']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388201718l/50398.jpg,"{'1x': [], '1.5x': [], '2x': [], '2.5x': [], '3x': [], '3.5x': [], '4x': []}",[],Barnes & Noble Classics

Persuasion,Jane Austen,9780192802637.0,0192802631,249,4.14,598043,1817-01-01,,,Persuasion,Standalone,1,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2156,"Persuasion is Jane Austen's last completed novel. She began it soon after she had finished Emma, completing it in August 1816. She died, aged 41, in 1817; Persuasion was published in December that year (but dated 1818). Persuasion is linked to Northanger Abbey not only by the fact that the two books were originally bound up in one volume and published together, but also because both stories are set partly in Bath, a fashionable city with which Austen was well acquainted, having lived there from 1801 to 1805. Besides the theme of persuasion, the novel evokes other topics, such as the Royal Navy, in which two of Jane Austen's brothers ultimately rose to the rank of admiral. As in Northanger Abbey, the superficial social life of Bath-well known to Austen, who spent several relatively unhappy and unproductive years there-is portrayed extensively and serves as a setting for the second half of the book. In many respects Persuasion marks a break with Austen's previous works, both in the more biting, even irritable satire directed at some of the novel's characters and in the regretful, resigned outlook of its otherwise admirable heroine, Anne Elliot, in the first part of the story. Against this is set the energy and appeal of the Royal Navy, which symbolises for Anne and the reader the possibility of a more outgoing, engaged, and fulfilling life, and it is this worldview which triumphs for the most part at the end of the novel.","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Romance', 'Historical', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literature']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1385172413l/2156.jpg,"{'1x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71DsUSGNw8L._AC_UY218_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71DsUSGNw8L._AC_UY654_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71n-MoAVFJS._AC_UY545_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '1.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71DsUSGNw8L._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71n-MoAVFJS._AC_UY218_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71n-MoAVFJS._AC_UY654_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '2x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71DsUSGNw8L._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71n-MoAVFJS._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91M2IJG7gSL._AC_UY218_.jpg'], '2.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71DsUSGNw8L._AC_UY545_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71n-MoAVFJS._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91M2IJG7gSL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '3x': [], '3.5x': [], '4x': []}","['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71DsUSGNw8L.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/713IEmiYcqL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71n-MoAVFJS.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71JGFFV4lsS.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ICeyEZSCS.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81MkrwfqOsS.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/817MarsgOBS.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71YlbifhuWS.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81uS8R9bEqS.jpg']",Oxford University Press

The first Afghan novel to be written in English, The Kite Runner tells a sweeping story of family, love, and friendship against a backdrop of history that has not been told in fiction before, bringing to mind the large canvases of the Russian writers of the nineteenth century.

Generations of readers young and old, male and female, have fallen in love with the March sisters of Louisa May Alcott’s most popular and enduring novel, Little Women. Here are talented tomboy and author-to-be Jo, tragically frail Beth, beautiful Meg, and romantic, spoiled Amy, united in their devotion to each other and their struggles to survive in New England during the Civil War.
It is no secret that Alcott based Little Women on her own early life. While her father, the freethinking reformer and abolitionist Bronson Alcott, hobnobbed with such eminent male authors as Emerson, Thoreau, and Hawthorne, Louisa supported herself and her sisters with ""woman’s work,” including sewing, doing laundry, and acting as a domestic servant. But she soon discovered she could make more money writing. Little Women brought her lasting fame and fortune, and far from being the ""girl’s book” her publisher requested, it explores such timeless themes as love and death, war and peace, the conflict between personal ambition and family responsibilities, and the clash of cultures between Europe and America.

Professor Dumbledore has given them clues about what they need to do to defeat the dark wizard, Lord Voldemort, once and for all, but it's up to them to figure out what these hints and suggestions really mean. Their cross-country odyssey has them searching desperately for the answers, while evading capture or death at every turn. At the same time, their friendship, fortitude, and sense of right and wrong are tested in ways they never could have imagined. The ultimate battle between good and evil that closes out this final chapter of the epic series takes place where Harry's Wizarding life began: at Hogwarts. The satisfying conclusion offers shocking last-minute twists, incredible acts of courage, powerful new forms of magic, and the resolution of many mysteries. Above all, this intense, cathartic book serves as a clear statement of the message at the heart of the Harry Potter series: that choice matters much more than destiny, and that love will always triumph over death.","['Young Adult', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Magic', 'Childrens', 'Adventure']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1474171184l/136251._SY475_.jpg,"{'1x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81qmfY6mMrL._AC_UY218_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81qmfY6mMrL._AC_UY654_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/615OnP56jBL._AC_UY545_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '1.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81qmfY6mMrL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/615OnP56jBL._AC_UY218_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/615OnP56jBL._AC_UY654_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '2x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81qmfY6mMrL._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/615OnP56jBL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61B9RZ-m3eL._AC_UY218_.jpg'], '2.5x': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81qmfY6mMrL._AC_UY545_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/615OnP56jBL._AC_UY436_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61B9RZ-m3eL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg'], '3x': [], '3.5x': [], '4x': []}","['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/615OnP56jBL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/914CT7iyyvL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41BEfCMdSxL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Kgt93-eXL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81yheYBjiuL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/514YKzftWpL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61B9RZ-m3eL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/914CT7iyyvL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41BEfCMdSxL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Kgt93-eXL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91HHqVTAJQL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41CvugDkDnL.jpg']",Arthur A.

Flames are spreading.
And the Capitol wants revenge.
Against all odds, Katniss Everdeen has won the Hunger Games. She and fellow District 12 tribute Peeta Mellark are miraculously still alive. Katniss should be relieved, happy even. After all, she has returned to her family and her longtime friend, Gale. Yet nothing is the way Katniss wishes it to be. Gale holds her at an icy distance. Peeta has turned his back on her completely. And there are whispers of a rebellion against the Capitol—a rebellion that Katniss and Peeta may have helped create.
Much to her shock, Katniss has fueled an unrest that she's afraid she cannot stop. And what scares her even more is that she's not entirely convinced she should try. As time draws near for Katniss and Peeta to visit the districts on the Capitol's cruel Victory Tour, the stakes are higher than ever. If they can't prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that they are lost in their love for each other, the consequences will be horrifying.
