# The Book Gallery

The repository is made to host my small webpage, The Book Gallery.

I hope to built a full website which has the following features:

- A home page featuring some (possibly random) books
- Each book having separate page with information
- Books should be divided
  - Genre
  - Author
  - Year Published
- Genre page where some sample of books selected from that genre is displayed 
- Same with author
- A random book page
- A random author page

... and much more!

## Website Available!
~~The website is available to view. You can see it at [Book-Gallery](https://h31416-book-gallery.herokuapp.com/).~~

> Heroku is removing its free tier and hence I can not make the app available on heroku anymore. You can still access it on Azure by the [link](https://hari31416-bookgallery.azurewebsites.net/)
